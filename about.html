            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This taxonomy was derived using embedding-based clustering, with no predefined schema imposed. The structure emerges from the content patterns in the article corpus.</p>

            <h2>Clustering Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Primary Clustering:</strong> Agglomerative clustering with Ward linkage on article embeddings. The optimal number of clusters (10-15) was determined by silhouette score optimization.</p>
            <p><strong>Subclustering:</strong> Each primary cluster is further divided into subclusters using the same method. The number of subclusters varies per primary based on internal diversity (2-20 subclusters, minimum 15 articles each).</p>

            <h2>Article Selection</h2>
            <p><strong>Most Representative:</strong> Articles closest to the subcluster centroid in embedding space.</p>
            <p><strong>Edge Cases:</strong> Articles farthest from the centroid while still assigned to the subcluster. These reveal boundary cases and taxonomy ambiguities.</p>

            <h2>LLM Enrichment</h2>
            <p>Cluster names and descriptions were generated by Claude (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) based on sample articles from each cluster. No predefined categories were imposed.</p>
