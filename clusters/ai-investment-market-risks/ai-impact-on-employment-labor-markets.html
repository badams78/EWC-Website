            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines AI's direct effects on employment patterns, job displacement, and labor market dynamics. Articles analyze workforce data from Census Bureau surveys, job posting platforms like Adzuna, and employment statistics to track AI's impact on hiring, particularly for entry-level positions and young workers aged 22-25. Key themes include sectoral employment shifts, occupational exposure to AI technologies, and changing demand for different skill levels. Unlike sibling subclusters focused on capital investment flows or AI performance metrics, this group emphasizes human workforce consequences, using labor economics research and demographic analysis to document employment "churn," job market polarization, and automation's evolving role in replacing versus augmenting workers across industries.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses automation's impact on labor markets (fitting the assigned cluster), it focuses more on the broader innovation dynamics and economic mechanisms of how different types of technological innovations affect demand and productivity over time, which aligns closely with the "Productivity Growth & Innovation Dynamics" cluster. The research emphasizes the economic theory and long-term trends of automation versus augmentation innovations rather than analyzing specific employment data or job displacement patterns that typically characterize the assigned cluster.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses employment patterns among software developers (fitting the cluster's focus on AI's effects on employment), it's primarily a methodological critique of how to interpret age-based workforce data rather than directly analyzing AI's impact on job displacement or labor market dynamics.
