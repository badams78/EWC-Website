            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines emerging concerns about diminishing returns and performance plateaus in AI development, contrasting sharply with the investment surge focus of its sibling cluster. Articles analyze whether AI scaling laws are breaking down, citing specific model releases like Google's Gemini 3 and GPT-5 that underwhelmed expectations despite massive resource investments. The content draws from technology analysts like Kedrosky, investment firms like Bridgewater, and academic institutions like MIT to evaluate whether current AI models have hit bounded performance ceilings. Unlike the sibling cluster's emphasis on capital expenditure trends, this subcluster focuses on technical limitations, data constraints, and the growing gap between investment inputs and performance outputs in AI systems.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is clearly misclassified as it discusses banking sector lending trends and corporate credit markets, which has no connection to AI performance plateaus or diminishing returns in artificial intelligence development. The article belongs in the "Corporate Credit and Banking Sector Lending" cluster, as it directly analyzes how banks' role in providing credit to non-financial corporations has declined over time.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "AI Performance Plateaus and Diminishing Returns" cluster because while it demonstrates a clear AI failure (ChatGPT providing confidently wrong answers), it presents an isolated anecdotal example rather than systematic evidence of broader performance plateaus or diminishing returns in AI development. The content focuses more on AI accuracy and reliability issues in a specific use case rather than analyzing trends in AI performance improvements leveling off or facing developmental limitations.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it shows GPT-4 achieving strong absolute performance in medical diagnosis, it doesn't demonstrate the performance plateaus or diminishing returns that define this cluster - instead, it shows clear performance gains over conventional methods.
