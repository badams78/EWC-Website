            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines emerging evidence that AI model performance gains are decelerating despite massive investments. Articles analyze specific model releases like GPT-5 and Gemini 3, documenting underwhelming improvements and suggesting fundamental scaling limitations. Data sources include performance benchmarks, industry analyst reports from firms like Bridgewater, and startup technology assessments. The coverage spans technical constraints like data availability and compute limits alongside market reception analysis. Unlike its sibling subcluster focused on raw investment flows and capital expenditure trends, this subcluster critically evaluates whether those investments are yielding proportional returns, questioning the sustainability of current AI scaling paradigms.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is clearly misclassified as it discusses banking sector lending trends and corporate credit markets, which has no connection to AI performance or diminishing returns in AI model development. The article should be reassigned to the "Corporate Credit and Banking Sector Lending" cluster, which is directly relevant to its content about banks' declining role in providing credit to non-financial corporations.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "AI Performance Plateaus & Diminishing Returns" cluster because while it demonstrates a specific failure case of ChatGPT providing confidently incorrect information, it represents an anecdotal quality issue rather than systematic evidence of performance plateaus or diminishing returns from increased investment. The article focuses on a single instance of AI providing wrong answers rather than analyzing broader trends in model performance improvements or the relationship between resources invested and capabilities gained.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it measures AI performance (GPT-4's diagnostic accuracy), it actually demonstrates strong AI capabilities rather than plateaus or diminishing returns - GPT-4 significantly outperformed conventional resources and even improved physician performance. The study focuses on current AI effectiveness in medical diagnosis rather than analyzing the deceleration of performance gains across model generations that defines the assigned cluster.</div>
