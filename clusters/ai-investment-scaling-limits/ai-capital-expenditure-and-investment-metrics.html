            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster focuses on quantitative analysis of AI-related capital expenditure, debt issuance, and investment metrics from major financial institutions and hyperscalers. Articles predominantly feature data from investment banks like Morgan Stanley, JPM, and Barclays, alongside market data from organizations like DTCC and OECD. The content emphasizes measurable financial indicators including debt volumes, GDP growth contributions, return thresholds, and capital expenditure comparisons. Unlike broader AI investment discussions, this cluster specifically examines the financial mechanics and market metrics underlying AI infrastructure spending, often highlighting how AI capex now dominates total investment growth while non-AI sectors decline.</p>

Michael Cembalest notes an uptick in revenue from cloud services, which "likely includes most AI activity."</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it discusses Nvidia's founder and entrepreneurial risk-taking philosophy rather than quantitative metrics about AI capital expenditure, debt, or investment data. While Nvidia is a key player in AI infrastructure, the content focuses on leadership and risk management concepts rather than the financial metrics and institutional investment analysis that defines this cluster.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "AI Capital Expenditure and Investment Metrics" cluster because it discusses EU AI regulations that could impact investment decisions and capital allocation in AI development, but it lacks the quantitative financial data and specific investment metrics that define the cluster's focus. While regulatory concerns can influence capital expenditure patterns, the article is primarily about policy and competitive positioning rather than actual financial analysis of AI investments.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions specific GPU quantities and spending amounts that align with AI capital expenditure metrics, it focuses more on hardware procurement and GPU acquisition rather than the broader financial analysis, debt issuance, and investment metrics that characterize the cluster. The content is more about semiconductor purchasing decisions than comprehensive capex analysis, which explains why it shows higher similarity to the Semiconductor Trade & Manufacturing Policy cluster.</div>
