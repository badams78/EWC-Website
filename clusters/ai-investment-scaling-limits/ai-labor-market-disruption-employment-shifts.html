            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines AI's immediate impact on employment patterns and labor market dynamics, focusing on measurable disruptions across occupations and demographics. Articles analyze Census Bureau data, job posting platforms like Adzuna, and sector-specific employment statistics to track how AI adoption affects hiring, particularly for entry-level and younger workers. Common themes include declining demand for junior roles, increased labor market churn, and differential impacts across skill levels and AI-exposed occupations. Unlike sibling clusters examining capital investment flows or technical performance limits, this subcluster concentrates on human workforce consequences and real-time employment shifts resulting from AI deployment.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions labor-replacing automation (relevant to employment disruption), it focuses more on the broader economic dynamics between automation and augmentation innovations over four decades, which aligns better with productivity and innovation trends rather than immediate AI-specific employment impacts. The research appears to be analyzing long-term technological patterns rather than current AI labor market disruptions across specific occupations and demographics.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it focuses on a narrow methodological debate about interpreting employment data for a specific age cohort of software developers, rather than examining the broader AI-driven labor market disruptions and employment shifts that define the cluster.
