            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines China's internal governance challenges and societal pressures, focusing on domestic policy decisions, social control measures, and economic problems affecting Chinese citizens. Articles typically cover youth unemployment crises, military leadership changes, censorship campaigns, anti-corruption investigations, and political attendance at key meetings. Content sources include government announcements, economic statistics, and policy analysis. Unlike its sibling subcluster on trade surplus and export growth which tracks China's external economic performance, this subcluster reveals internal structural weaknesses and the CCP's responses to domestic instability through social controls and political purges.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "China Domestic Policy & Social Issues" cluster because it focuses on U.S. legislative action against a Chinese-owned company rather than China's internal governance or domestic policy decisions. While it involves a Chinese company (TikTok's parent), the policy debate and decision-making is entirely within the U.S. political system, not about China's domestic affairs or how Chinese policies affect Chinese citizens.</div>
