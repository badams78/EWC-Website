            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines China's internal political dynamics and structural economic challenges, particularly youth unemployment and domestic governance issues. Articles analyze CCP leadership changes, military appointments, political purges, and censorship campaigns alongside critical employment data showing youth joblessness reaching nearly 19%. Coverage includes government statistics, policy announcements, and analysis of social control measures. Unlike the trade-focused sibling subcluster examining China's external economic relationships, this grouping concentrates on domestic stability concerns, including TikTok regulatory battles that reflect broader US-China tensions over technology and influence.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "China Domestic Politics & Youth Employment" cluster because it focuses on U.S. legislative action against TikTok rather than China's internal political dynamics or youth employment issues. While it involves a Chinese company, the content is primarily about American domestic policy and regulatory decisions, making it more relevant to U.S. political processes than Chinese internal affairs.</div>
