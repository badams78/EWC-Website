            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster focuses on China's growing trade surpluses and export performance, particularly with major trading partners like the US and Europe. Articles analyze quantitative trade data including export growth rates, bilateral surplus figures, and comparative statistics on Chinese economic indicators versus other economies. Content draws from official trade statistics, economic surveys, and analytical reports examining China's evolving trade relationships. Coverage includes tariff responses from trading partners, shifts in import dependencies, and China's competitive positioning in global markets. The subcluster emphasizes empirical trade flow analysis and policy implications of China's export-driven growth model.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P8_S2</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "China Trade Surplus & Export Growth" cluster because it focuses on domestic U.S. airline labor costs rather than international trade data or China's export performance. While the $9.6 billion cost figure might superficially relate to economic data analysis, the article's core content about American Airlines pilot compensation has no relevance to China's trade relationships or export growth metrics.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P6_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses industrial robots (which could be relevant to China's manufacturing exports), it focuses specifically on the technological advancement and cost reduction of robots over time rather than China's actual trade performance, export data, or trade surplus metrics. The content is more aligned with productivity and innovation dynamics than with quantitative trade analysis.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P4_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it focuses entirely on U.S. domestic employment patterns (independent contractors) rather than China's trade surpluses or export performance, which is the core topic of the assigned cluster. The article would be much better suited for the "Employment Patterns and Workforce Participation" cluster since it directly analyzes American workforce composition and employment survey methodology.</div>
