            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines Apple's strategic shift away from China-centric manufacturing toward geographic diversification, particularly emphasizing India as an alternative production hub. Articles track quantitative metrics like production percentages, investment figures, and year-over-year growth rates, drawing from industry analyses and corporate disclosures. Coverage focuses on operational logistics, supplier relocations, and automation strategies rather than military applications. Unlike sibling subclusters addressing semiconductor competition or defense spending, this group concentrates on commercial supply chain resilience and market access considerations, positioning Apple's manufacturing decisions within broader US-China economic decoupling trends.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it directly discusses Apple's supply chain diversification from China to India (perfectly matching the cluster theme), it lacks the detailed strategic analysis, timeline specifics, or broader geographic diversification context that would typically characterize articles with high similarity to this cluster's centroid. The article presents only basic facts about the India manufacturing milestone and production target without the deeper strategic insights that define the cluster's core content.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses China's trade surplus figures, it focuses on general balance of payments methodology and economic statistics rather than specifically addressing Apple's supply chain diversification or manufacturing strategy shifts away from China. The content is more aligned with broader China trade and economic analysis than with Apple's corporate strategy to reduce dependence on Chinese manufacturing.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P5_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it directly relates to Apple's supply chain diversification efforts away from China, it focuses on the obstacles and challenges (Chinese export restrictions) rather than the strategic implementation and progress of the diversification itself. The article emphasizes geopolitical barriers to diversification rather than Apple's proactive diversification strategy, making it potentially better suited for a cluster about trade restrictions or supply chain competition.</div>
