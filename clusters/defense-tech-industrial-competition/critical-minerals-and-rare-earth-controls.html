            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the geopolitical dimensions of critical minerals and rare earth elements, focusing on supply chain vulnerabilities and strategic competition between major powers. Articles analyze China's dominant position in rare earth production and processing, representing over 90% of global magnet manufacturing, alongside Western efforts to diversify supply chains through domestic mining projects, strategic partnerships, and government equity investments. Coverage includes trade policy analysis, export control mechanisms, stockpiling initiatives, and geological assessments of new mineral deposits. Unlike sibling clusters focused on semiconductors or military alliances, this subcluster emphasizes raw material dependencies and the intersection of natural resource geology with national security policy.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Critical Minerals and Rare Earth Controls" cluster because while it involves foreign acquisition of a major U.S. steel producer (which relates to critical materials and national security concerns), the focus is on corporate governance structures and regulatory approval processes rather than supply chain vulnerabilities or strategic competition over mineral resources. The content is more aligned with foreign investment controls and corporate dealmaking than with the geopolitical dimensions of critical minerals that define the cluster.</div>
