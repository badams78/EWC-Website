            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the intensifying global competition in drone manufacturing and defense technology innovation, particularly between US and Chinese capabilities. Articles analyze production capacity disparities, with China's DJI dominating commercial drone manufacturing while US companies like Anduril advance military autonomous systems. Coverage includes battlefield effectiveness data from Ukraine, DoD procurement shifts toward newer defense contractors, and traditional aerospace manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus adapting to emerging threats. Unlike sibling subclusters focused on supply chains or alliances, this group emphasizes manufacturing scale, technological innovation races, and market disruption in defense sectors.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions autonomous technology, it focuses on self-driving cars and AI development challenges rather than drone manufacturing or defense innovation competition. The content about AI performance limitations and investment returns aligns much better with the "AI Performance Plateaus & Diminishing Returns" cluster, as it directly addresses the gap between massive investment ($80bn) and disappointing technological progress in autonomous systems.</div>
