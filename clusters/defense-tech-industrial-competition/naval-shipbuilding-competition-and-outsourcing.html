            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines naval shipbuilding capacity competition between the US and China, emphasizing America's industrial disadvantage in military vessel production. Articles frequently cite tonnage statistics, GDP spending ratios, and shipyard capacity data to illustrate China's overwhelming manufacturing superiority in both commercial and military vessels. The focus extends to US outsourcing strategies involving South Korean and allied shipbuilders, port infrastructure impacts, and missile system deployments. Unlike sibling subclusters addressing semiconductor supply chains or rare earth minerals, this domain centers specifically on maritime defense manufacturing capabilities and allied naval cooperation agreements rather than broader technology or resource competition.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it focuses on civilian renewable energy infrastructure (high-voltage cables for renewable projects) rather than military naval shipbuilding, which is the core theme of the assigned cluster. The article would be better suited for the "Global Electricity Demand Growth & Investment" cluster since it directly addresses supply constraints affecting renewable energy project development.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it relates to naval military technology and US-China competition, it focuses on submarine detection/tracking research rather than the shipbuilding capacity and industrial production that defines the cluster's core theme. The article fits better with scientific research breakthroughs since it's specifically about a Chinese research center's technological development rather than naval construction capabilities or tonnage comparisons.</div>
