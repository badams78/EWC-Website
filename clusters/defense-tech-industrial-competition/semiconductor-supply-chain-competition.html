            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the strategic competition between the US and China over semiconductor supply chains and manufacturing capabilities. Articles focus on chip export controls, particularly around Nvidia's advanced AI chips (H200, Blackwell), Chinese firms like SMIC and DeepSeek navigating restrictions, and domestic manufacturing investments by both nations. Coverage draws from trade publications, government policy announcements, and industry analysis, with perspectives spanning geopolitical strategy and technical capabilities. The subcluster emphasizes the intersection of national security policy and commercial competition in critical technologies, distinguishing itself through its focus on supply chain dynamics rather than broader defense technology development or military applications.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Semiconductor Supply Chain Competition" cluster because while it involves Huawei (a key player in US-China tech competition) and mentions telecom infrastructure that relies on semiconductors, the article primarily focuses on manufacturing facilities and 5G network licensing decisions rather than specifically addressing semiconductor supply chains, chip manufacturing, or export controls that define the cluster's core theme.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it involves Chinese ownership of a semiconductor company (Nexperia), it focuses more on domestic governance and leadership changes rather than the core theme of US-China strategic competition over semiconductor supply chains and export controls.
