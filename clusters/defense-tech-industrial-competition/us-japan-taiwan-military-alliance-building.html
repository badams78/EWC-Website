            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster focuses on military alliance formation and strategic cooperation between the US, Japan, and Taiwan in response to China's growing military presence in the Indo-Pacific. Articles primarily cover defense spending increases, military base expansions, joint command structures, and arms deals, particularly Japan's shift from pacifist policies to active military buildup and Taiwan's defensive acquisitions. Content draws from military leadership statements, defense budget announcements, and geopolitical analyses from major financial and defense publications. Unlike sibling clusters examining supply chain vulnerabilities or broader defense spending patterns, this subcluster specifically addresses bilateral and trilateral security partnerships and their operational military dimensions in the Pacific theater.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P14_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it focuses purely on trade relationships and economic partnerships between the US and Vietnam, with no mention of military alliances, defense cooperation, or the strategic Japan-Taiwan triangle that defines the assigned cluster. The content is much more aligned with trade and economic themes rather than military alliance building, which explains why it has higher similarity to the China Trade Surplus & Export Growth cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P5_S7</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses Japanese naval capabilities that could theoretically support US-Japan alliance operations, it focuses specifically on Japan's independent missile defense testing and fleet expansion rather than explicit trilateral cooperation or alliance-building activities with the US and Taiwan. The content is more aligned with naval capabilities development than strategic alliance formation, making the alternative "Naval Shipbuilding Competition and Outsourcing" cluster a potentially better fit given its focus on naval fleet expansion and capabilities.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "US-Japan-Taiwan Military Alliance Building" cluster because while it discusses US strategic partnership expansion in the Indo-Pacific region (which relates to broader alliance building against China), it specifically focuses on US-Vietnam relations rather than the US-Japan-Taiwan trilateral cooperation that defines the cluster. The article's emphasis on diplomatic relationship upgrades rather than explicit military alliance formation makes it tangentially related but not central to the cluster's core theme.</div>
