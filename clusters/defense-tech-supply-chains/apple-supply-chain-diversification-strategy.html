            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines Apple's strategic shift away from China-concentrated manufacturing toward geographic diversification, particularly emphasizing India as a primary alternative production hub. Articles track quantitative metrics including investment flows, production percentages, and year-over-year manufacturing changes across regions. Coverage draws from financial analyses, supply chain reports, and trade policy assessments, documenting Apple's $55B Chinese investments alongside emerging Indian operations growing from 1% to 20% of iPhone production. Unlike sibling clusters focusing on broader semiconductor policy or military spending, this subcluster specifically analyzes one company's supply chain reconfiguration as a microcosm of US-China economic decoupling and corporate risk mitigation strategies.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P5_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it clearly discusses Apple's supply chain diversification from China to India (fitting the cluster), it focuses specifically on a product launch milestone rather than the broader strategic, operational, or policy aspects of supply chain diversification that typically define this cluster. The article's narrow scope on a single manufacturing achievement makes it somewhat peripheral to the cluster's comprehensive coverage of diversification strategy.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P14_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses China's economic data (specifically trade surplus underreporting), it doesn't mention Apple or supply chain diversification at all - it's purely about Chinese macroeconomic statistics. The article fits much better with the "China Trade Surplus & Export Growth" cluster since it directly addresses China's balance of payments methodology and trade surplus calculations, which is exactly what that cluster covers.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P5_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it directly relates to Apple's supply chain diversification efforts away from China toward Southeast Asia and India, it focuses primarily on China's regulatory response (increased customs checks on dual-use equipment) rather than Apple's proactive diversification strategy itself. The content emphasizes trade policy and export controls more than corporate supply chain planning, making it arguably better suited for the "Semiconductor Trade & Manufacturing Policy" cluster despite its Apple supply chain context.</div>
