            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines China's rapid electric vehicle market expansion and resulting international trade frictions. Articles track Chinese automakers like BYD achieving dramatic sales growth and market share gains, export surges from 1 million to 4.9 million vehicles, and domestic policy mandates strengthening supply chains. Coverage emphasizes quantitative market data, production statistics, and trade flow analysis. The focus shifts to defensive responses from EU and US markets, including tariffs up to 45% on Chinese EVs and concerns about automotive employment impacts. Unlike sibling clusters examining semiconductor policy or defense spending, this subcluster specifically addresses consumer automotive markets where Chinese companies compete directly with established Western manufacturers, creating visible trade tensions beyond traditional national security sectors.</p>
