            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines global competition for critical minerals essential to defense and technology manufacturing, with particular focus on China's market dominance and Western efforts to reduce supply chain dependencies. Articles analyze rare earth elements, lithium, copper, and other strategic materials through trade policy, mining investment, and stockpiling initiatives. Content draws from industry reports, government policy announcements, and geopolitical analysis. Unlike sibling clusters focused on finished semiconductors or military spending, this subcluster addresses upstream raw material control and extraction as foundational elements of technological sovereignty and national security strategy.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it focuses on a specific lithium deposit discovery and mining timeline rather than examining the broader geopolitical competition and supply chain control issues that define the cluster's theme. While lithium is indeed a critical mineral, the article lacks discussion of China's market dominance, Western supply chain diversification efforts, or the strategic competition aspects that characterize this subcluster.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it involves a foreign acquisition of a U.S. steel company (which could have national security implications for defense manufacturing), it doesn't specifically discuss critical minerals, rare earth elements, or supply chain dependencies that define the cluster's focus. The article is more about corporate governance structures and regulatory approval processes rather than the strategic control of essential materials for technology and defense sectors.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Critical Minerals & Rare Earth Controls" cluster because while it discusses the decline of a major US steel company, it focuses on corporate innovation failures and market valuation rather than the geopolitical competition for critical minerals or supply chain dependencies that define the cluster.
