            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the strategic competition in naval shipbuilding capabilities and maritime defense infrastructure between major powers, particularly the US and China. Articles analyze shipbuilding capacity metrics, military vessel construction programs, port security measures, and international maritime partnerships. Common sources include defense spending data, shipyard production statistics, and policy announcements from naval programs. The content frequently compares national shipbuilding outputs and discusses supply chain vulnerabilities in maritime defense. Unlike sibling clusters focused on semiconductors or rare earth minerals, this subcluster emphasizes physical maritime assets and naval industrial base competition, covering both commercial shipbuilding dominance and military vessel procurement challenges.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P3_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article about high-voltage cable supply constraints for renewable energy projects has very little connection to naval shipbuilding and maritime defense competition, making it a clear misclassification. The article belongs in the "Global Power Demand Growth & Investment" cluster since it directly addresses infrastructure bottlenecks affecting renewable energy development, which is fundamentally about power generation and grid investment rather than military naval capabilities.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P3_S2</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions submarine tracking technology which relates to maritime defense, it focuses primarily on a Chinese research center's technological breakthrough rather than naval shipbuilding capabilities or defense infrastructure competition. The content is more about scientific research and technological advancement (tracking methods) than the strategic competition in building naval vessels or maritime defense systems that defines the assigned cluster.</div>

            <div class="title">3. Chinese researchers claim to have developed a method for tracking submarines via their magnetic fields. “The future lies in merging physics with AI. Magnetic wakes add another layer to the kill web – a system where even ghosts leave traces.” @SCMPNews</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P3_S8</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the Naval Shipbuilding cluster because while it relates to submarine warfare and maritime defense, it focuses on detection technology and physics-AI integration rather than shipbuilding capabilities or defense infrastructure competition. The emphasis on magnetic field tracking methods and the physics-AI merger makes it more aligned with technological breakthroughs than traditional naval construction and defense systems.</div>
