            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines military partnerships, defense agreements, and strategic positioning across the Pacific region, with particular focus on US-Japan cooperation and responses to China's military expansion. Articles analyze defense spending commitments, infrastructure buildups, command structure integrations, and major weapons procurement deals. Content draws heavily from military leadership statements, government policy announcements, and trade publications covering geopolitical developments. Unlike sibling subclusters focusing on semiconductor manufacturing policies or broader defense investment trends, this group specifically addresses bilateral and multilateral security arrangements, territorial fortification efforts, and operational military coordination between Pacific allies in response to evolving regional threat assessments.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P14_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions Vietnam and US trade relationships in the Pacific region, it focuses entirely on commercial trade statistics rather than military alliances, defense agreements, or strategic military positioning. The content is purely economic and would be much better suited for the "China Trade Surplus & Export Growth" cluster, as it directly discusses US trading partners and trade percentages.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P5_S7</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions Japanese naval capabilities that are relevant to regional defense partnerships, the focus is primarily on technical military hardware (Aegis destroyers, missile interception tests, fleet expansion) rather than the diplomatic or strategic alliance aspects that define the Pacific Military Alliances cluster. The content aligns more closely with naval shipbuilding and maritime defense competition, as it emphasizes Japan's growing naval capabilities and weapons systems rather than cooperation frameworks or alliance dynamics.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses Vietnam's strategic diplomatic upgrade with the US (which has defense implications in the Pacific region), it focuses more on the diplomatic relationship change itself rather than specific military alliances, defense agreements, or strategic military positioning that the cluster emphasizes. The article lacks concrete details about defense cooperation or military partnerships, making it only tangentially related to the cluster's core focus on military alliances and regional defense structures.</div>
