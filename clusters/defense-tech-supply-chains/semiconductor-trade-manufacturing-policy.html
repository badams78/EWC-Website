            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the intersection of semiconductor technology, international trade policy, and geopolitical competition, particularly between the US and China. Articles focus on chip export controls, manufacturing capacity building, AI chip access restrictions, and corporate supply chain decisions. Common sources include industry analysis from firms like Semianalysis, financial media reporting on policy changes, and trade publication coverage of regulatory developments. The content spans policy analysis of export restrictions like H200 chip sales to China, manufacturing investment tracking, and corporate strategic responses to trade barriers. Unlike broader defense technology clusters, this specifically targets the semiconductor industry's role in technological competition, emphasizing trade restrictions, manufacturing localization efforts, and the race for AI chip supremacy between major powers.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Semiconductor Trade & Manufacturing Policy" cluster because while it discusses Huawei's manufacturing expansion and geopolitical trade tensions with France, it focuses on telecom equipment and 5G infrastructure rather than semiconductors specifically. The content is more about telecom policy decisions and network equipment than the chip manufacturing, export controls, or semiconductor trade policies that define the cluster's core theme.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P5_S5</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it involves semiconductor policy and geopolitical tensions (fitting the cluster), it focuses more on direct government intervention and executive changes at a specific company rather than broader trade policies, export controls, or manufacturing strategies that typically define semiconductor trade policy discussions. The emphasis on Chinese leadership changes and European management succession makes it as much about corporate governance amid geopolitical pressures as it is about semiconductor trade policy itself.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions a Chinese AI company (DeepSeek) which could relate to US-China tech competition, the content focuses specifically on AI model pricing and cost efficiency rather than semiconductor trade policies, export controls, or manufacturing regulations. The article's emphasis on token costs and AI service pricing aligns much better with discussions about AI performance and economics than with semiconductor trade policy matters.</div>
