            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines Apple's strategic shift away from China-concentrated manufacturing toward supply chain diversification, particularly through expanded production in India. Articles track quantitative metrics like Apple's iPhone production percentages by country, year-over-year growth rates, and capital investment figures. The content draws from industry reports, Bloomberg analyses, and supply chain data to document Apple's operational responses to geopolitical tensions. Unlike sibling subclusters focused on semiconductors, defense spending, or minerals policy, this group specifically analyzes how a major consumer technology company restructures global manufacturing networks, automation strategies, and supplier relationships to reduce geographic concentration risks while maintaining production efficiency.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P5_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it clearly discusses Apple's production shift from China to India (fitting the cluster theme), it focuses narrowly on a single milestone event (iPhone launch day manufacturing) rather than examining the broader strategic supply chain diversification efforts that define the cluster. The article's emphasis on a specific product launch timing makes it somewhat tangential to the cluster's focus on comprehensive supply chain strategy analysis.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P14_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses China's economic data and trade balance, it focuses specifically on balance of payments methodology and trade surplus calculations rather than Apple's manufacturing decisions or supply chain diversification strategies. The article would be better classified in the "China Trade Surplus & Export Growth" cluster since it directly addresses China's trade surplus reporting discrepancies, which aligns much more closely with that cluster's focus.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P5_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions Apple's supply chain diversification efforts, it primarily focuses on China's export restrictions on dual-use equipment rather than Apple's actual production shifts or manufacturing expansion in India. The content is more about trade policy and export controls affecting multiple American firms, which aligns better with the semiconductor supply chain and trade policy cluster.</div>
