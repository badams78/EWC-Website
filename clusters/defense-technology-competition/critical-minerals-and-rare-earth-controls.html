            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the strategic control and supply chain vulnerabilities of critical minerals and rare earth elements essential for defense technologies. Articles analyze China's dominant market position, export restrictions, and use of mineral dependencies as geopolitical leverage. Coverage includes US and allied efforts to diversify supply chains, establish domestic mining operations, build strategic stockpiles, and reduce Chinese dependencies. Sources range from trade policy analysis to mining industry reports and government procurement initiatives. Unlike sibling clusters focusing on semiconductor manufacturing or military spending, this subcluster emphasizes upstream raw material control and resource security as foundations of technological competition.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses lithium (a critical mineral essential for defense and energy technologies), it focuses primarily on a geological discovery and potential mining timeline rather than strategic supply chain controls, market dominance, or geopolitical vulnerabilities that define the cluster's core theme. The article lacks the strategic/control analysis aspect that characterizes the subcluster, making it more about resource discovery than critical mineral supply chain dynamics.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Critical Minerals and Rare Earth Controls" cluster because while it involves foreign control of a strategic U.S. industrial asset (steel production), it focuses on corporate governance and acquisition structures rather than the supply chain vulnerabilities or strategic control of critical minerals that define the cluster. The content is more aligned with foreign investment and trade dynamics than with the specific mineral resource control issues the cluster examines.</div>
