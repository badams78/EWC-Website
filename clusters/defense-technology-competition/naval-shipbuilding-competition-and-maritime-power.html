            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the intensifying maritime competition between major powers, particularly the US-China rivalry in naval capabilities and shipbuilding capacity. Articles analyze shipbuilding output statistics, naval procurement programs like the Constellation-class frigate, defense spending as percentage of GDP, and strategic partnerships among allies. Coverage includes trade policy measures affecting maritime industries, sanctions on shipbuilders, and infrastructure constraints at major ports. Unlike sibling clusters focused on specific technologies or supply chains, this subcluster emphasizes traditional military hardware production capacity and sea power projection capabilities that underpin broader geopolitical competition.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P3_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions supply constraints for high-voltage cables, it focuses on renewable energy infrastructure rather than naval shipbuilding or maritime military competition between major powers. The content about power cables and energy projects has virtually no connection to the cluster's core theme of naval capabilities and shipbuilding competition, making it a clear misclassification that would be better suited for the energy/power demand cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P3_S2</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it involves naval/submarine technology that relates to maritime power competition between the US and China, it primarily focuses on a research breakthrough in tracking methodology rather than shipbuilding capacity or naval fleet development. The emphasis on a "research center" developing a "new method" makes it more aligned with scientific discovery than the shipbuilding and maritime power competition that defines the assigned cluster.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses submarine detection technology (relevant to naval warfare), it focuses primarily on a scientific breakthrough in magnetic field detection combined with AI rather than shipbuilding competition or maritime power dynamics between nations.
