            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the intersection of semiconductor technology and international trade policy within the broader US-China strategic competition. Articles focus on chip export controls, supply chain security, and manufacturing capacity building, particularly around advanced AI processors like Nvidia's H200 and Blackwell chips. Coverage includes policy shifts under different administrations, Chinese responses to restrictions, and European nations' regulatory decisions regarding companies like Nexperia. Sources range from industry analysis and government announcements to executive statements and market intelligence reports. The content emphasizes economic statecraft through technology controls, domestic manufacturing initiatives, and the global race for semiconductor self-sufficiency, distinguishing itself through detailed examination of specific chips, companies, and policy mechanisms rather than broader defense applications.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it involves a major Chinese tech company and international trade policy decisions, it focuses on telecom equipment manufacturing and 5G network infrastructure rather than semiconductor supply chains or chip-related trade policies. The content is more about general technology trade relationships and manufacturing facility placement rather than the specific semiconductor and chip export control issues that define the cluster.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it involves semiconductor industry governance and foreign investment restrictions (core themes of the assigned cluster), it primarily focuses on a specific corporate leadership change and government intervention in the Netherlands-China context rather than broader semiconductor supply chain policies or US-China trade dynamics. The mention of Chinese ownership and European management suggests it could also relate to broader trade competition themes covered in the alternative EV/auto industry cluster.</div>
