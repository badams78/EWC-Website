            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the global phenomenon of declining fertility rates and accompanying shifts in family formation patterns. Articles analyze demographic data showing precipitous birth rate drops across developed nations, particularly in East Asia, alongside delayed marriage trends and rising single-adult households. Content draws from census data, demographic projections, and social surveys to explore how economic factors influence family planning decisions. The analysis extends to long-term societal implications, including population aging, labor force changes, and economic sustainability challenges. While the parent cluster broadly covers migration and demographic trends, this subcluster specifically focuses on fertility collapse and evolving household structures rather than geographic population movements or immigration patterns.</p>
