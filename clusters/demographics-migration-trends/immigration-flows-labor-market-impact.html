            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines immigration policy mechanisms and their direct economic consequences, particularly labor market effects. Articles analyze specific programs like H-1B visas, asylum processing systems, and border enforcement, drawing on government data from Border Patrol, CPS surveys, and research from think tanks like AEI and Pew. Coverage spans policy proposals, statistical trends in immigrant flows, and quantitative assessments of economic impact by skill level. Unlike its sibling focusing on demographic transitions and family structures, this subcluster emphasizes policy-driven migration patterns and immediate economic outcomes rather than long-term societal changes.</p>
