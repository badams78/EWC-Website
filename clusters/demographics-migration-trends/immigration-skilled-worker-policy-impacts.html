            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster analyzes the economic and labor market impacts of immigration policies, particularly focusing on skilled worker programs like H-1B visas and asylum/border control measures. Articles examine productivity effects, fiscal impacts by education level, and demographic shifts in immigrant populations. Common sources include government data (DHS, Border Patrol, CPS), think tank analyses (AEI, Pew), and policy research on visa programs. The content emphasizes quantitative assessments of immigration's economic contributions and policy effectiveness. Unlike sibling subclusters examining broader demographic trends like fertility decline, this focuses specifically on policy-driven migration flows and their measurable economic consequences for host countries.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it involves China and international policy (making it somewhat relevant to the alternative "China Domestic Politics" cluster), it primarily focuses on Italy's foreign policy decision regarding trade infrastructure rather than immigration, skilled worker programs, or labor market impacts that define the assigned cluster. The article has no direct connection to immigration policy or skilled worker visa programs, making it a clear misclassification.</div>
