            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines comparative economic performance across regions, with particular focus on US-Europe productivity differentials and structural competitiveness factors. Articles analyze productivity growth rates, regulatory burdens, technological innovation gaps, venture capital flows, and currency impacts on economic performance. Common data sources include McKinsey research, central bank analyses, and financial sector reports comparing metrics like R&D spending, unicorn creation rates, and labor productivity trends. The subcluster emphasizes quantitative benchmarking between major economies, highlighting sectoral differences in innovation capacity and regulatory efficiency that drive divergent growth trajectories.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it does compare economic performance across regions (British vs European companies), it focuses specifically on corporate profit margins and valuation multiples rather than the broader productivity differentials and structural competitiveness factors that characterize the subcluster. The content is more aligned with corporate valuation analysis than macroeconomic productivity comparisons, making the alternative "Corporate Valuations & Market Concentration" cluster a potentially better fit.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it contains economic performance data and comparisons (Greek vs. Eurozone export growth), it focuses specifically on Greece's recovery through internal devaluation rather than the broader US-Europe productivity differentials and structural competitiveness factors that define the cluster. The content aligns more closely with country-specific economic recovery narratives than systematic productivity comparisons across major economic regions.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses regulatory barriers that impact European economic competitiveness (fitting the cluster's focus on structural factors affecting performance), it primarily uses a specific regulatory example rather than providing direct comparative economic or productivity data between regions. The content is more focused on illustrating regulatory burden through a concrete case study rather than analyzing broader economic performance metrics or productivity differentials that typically define this cluster.</div>
