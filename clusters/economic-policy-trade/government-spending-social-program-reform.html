            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines government fiscal policy through the lens of social program sustainability and spending reform. Articles analyze healthcare programs (ACA, Medicaid, Medicare), Social Security, and broader federal expenditure patterns using data from CBO, KFF, and academic research. Content focuses on trust fund solvency, benefit eligibility changes, and spending growth trajectories. Unlike sibling subclusters that emphasize economic performance metrics or climate-related policies, this group specifically addresses entitlement program challenges and reform proposals. Coverage includes both domestic U.S. policy analysis and international comparisons, particularly European welfare state reforms, providing empirical evidence on program costs, coverage impacts, and demographic pressures driving policy changes.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P2_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it technically involves government policy reform of a social program (retirement/pensions), the specific focus on raising retirement age to 70 is more closely related to demographic trends and aging populations than to typical government spending and fiscal policy discussions. The policy change appears to be a response to demographic pressures rather than a proactive spending reform initiative, making it conceptually closer to topics about population aging and family structure changes.</div>

            <div class="title">2. The key drivers of elevated European long yields are higher inflation and chronic fiscal deficits, but another catalyst may be lower demand for long-dated debt, as the $2T Dutch pension system transitions from a defined benefit to a defined contribution system.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P1_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions a major social program reform (Dutch pension system transition from defined benefit to defined contribution), its primary focus is on how this reform affects European bond yields and treasury market dynamics rather than analyzing the social program reform itself. The article's emphasis on debt market implications makes it more aligned with treasury market analysis than social program policy discussion.</div>

            <div class="title">3. The Danish Welfare Reform of 2006 linked the eligibility age for the state pension to life expectancy. Recent changes increase the statutory age of eligibility, from 67 today to age 70 by 2040, a reform that may secure the system’s fiscal sustainability.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P2_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses pension reform (a social program), it focuses specifically on demographic-driven policy changes linking retirement age to life expectancy rather than broader government spending patterns or fiscal sustainability measures that typically characterize this cluster. The high similarity to the fertility/family structure cluster (0.50) suggests the article's emphasis on demographic trends and aging populations may be more central to its content than traditional social program spending analysis.</div>
