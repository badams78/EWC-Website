            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the intersection of healthcare economics and tax policy, focusing on pharmaceutical industry taxation, Medicare financing, and health system performance metrics. Articles commonly reference Bureau of Economic Analysis data, OECD comparisons, and academic research findings. Key themes include corporate tax avoidance in pharma, price control impacts on drug development, and healthcare spending's relationship to income inequality. Unlike sibling clusters that address broader economic trends or general fiscal policy, this subcluster specifically analyzes healthcare sector economics and related tax structures, drawing from government agencies, economic researchers, and health policy experts to evaluate system efficiency and reform proposals.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it presents healthcare system performance metrics (waiting lists, doctor-to-population ratios) that relate to healthcare economics, it lacks any discussion of tax policy, pharmaceutical taxation, or Medicare financing that would be central to the assigned cluster.
