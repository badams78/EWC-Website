            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines government intervention in specific industries and sectors, focusing on targeted policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, manufacturing capacity initiatives, and clean energy investments. Articles analyze implementation challenges, effectiveness of industrial subsidies, and regulatory changes affecting business operations. Common sources include policy researchers, economic analysts, and government officials discussing "crowding in" effects and coordination difficulties. Unlike sibling clusters examining broad economic performance or global trends, this subcluster specifically scrutinizes how governments directly shape industrial development through tariffs, tax incentives, and sector-specific spending programs.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P8_S8</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses underinvestment (which relates to industrial policy), it focuses specifically on transportation infrastructure performance and travel times rather than targeted government interventions in specific industries or sectors. The content aligns better with infrastructure efficiency issues than with the cluster's emphasis on sector-specific policies like the Inflation Reduction Act or manufacturing initiatives.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P3_S6</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses government industrial policy (New York's investment in manufacturing), it focuses primarily on the failure and financial losses of a specific investment rather than examining broader policy frameworks, sector-wide interventions, or strategic initiatives like those mentioned in the subcluster description. The article's emphasis on investment performance and financial writedowns makes it more similar to investment analysis than industrial policy examination.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P6_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Industrial Policy & Government Intervention" cluster because it focuses on market-driven competition between low-cost airlines rather than discussing any specific government policies, regulations, or interventions in the airline industry. The content is more naturally aligned with market dynamics and corporate competition (as suggested by the higher similarity to the Corporate Valuations cluster) than with targeted government initiatives or sectoral policies.</div>
