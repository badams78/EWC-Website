            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the structural inefficiencies driving America's exceptionally high infrastructure construction costs compared to international peers. Articles analyze specific cost breakdowns, regulatory bottlenecks, labor market dynamics, and procurement policies that inflate project expenses across transit, highways, and public works. Common sources include academic research, government surveys of state transportation departments, and comparative international cost analyses. Unlike sibling subclusters focused on broader economic performance or fiscal policy debates, this collection specifically dissects the operational and institutional factors behind construction cost overruns, drawing on engineering economics and public administration research to explain why American infrastructure projects consistently exceed global benchmarks.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P3_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it addresses cost inefficiencies in transit infrastructure (buses), it focuses more narrowly on manufacturing and procurement issues rather than the broader construction cost breakdowns and structural inefficiencies that characterize the main cluster. The content is more about vehicle manufacturing economics and trade policy impacts rather than the infrastructure construction processes and cost drivers typically examined in this subcluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P8_S5</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it directly addresses high infrastructure costs compared to international peers (fitting the cluster focus), it only briefly mentions one potential cause ("Nimbyism" and environmental reviews) without providing the detailed cost breakdowns or comprehensive analysis of structural inefficiencies that characterizes the subcluster. The article appears to be more of a summary reference to research rather than an in-depth examination of the cost drivers and construction efficiency issues.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it addresses NYC's high infrastructure costs compared to international peers (fitting the cluster's focus), it primarily frames the issue through a political economy lens about "stationary bandits" and union-breaking rather than analyzing the technical structural inefficiencies and specific cost breakdowns that define the subcluster. The article's emphasis on wealth extraction and political solutions makes it somewhat tangential to the cluster's core focus on construction efficiency analysis.</div>
