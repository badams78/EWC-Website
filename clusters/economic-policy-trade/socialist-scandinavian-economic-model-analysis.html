            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines Nordic and socialist economic models through comparative analysis with capitalist systems, particularly focusing on Sweden, Finland, and broader Scandinavian experiences. Articles blend historical case studies with contemporary policy analysis, drawing from think tank research (notably American Enterprise Institute), academic sources, and economic data spanning the 1970s-present. Key themes include debunking socialist misconceptions about Nordic countries, analyzing wealth concentration patterns, and evaluating outcomes of mixed economies combining free markets with social welfare. Unlike sibling clusters focused on specific nations' current crises or technical policy mechanics, this subcluster emphasizes ideological model comparisons and long-term systemic performance across different economic philosophies.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P8_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses economic systems and their political implications, it focuses on historical transitions from feudalism to free market capitalism rather than specifically analyzing Nordic/Scandinavian socialist models or comparing them to capitalist systems. The content about economic independence leading to political liberty is more aligned with general economic policy debates about market efficiency and industrial policy than with the specialized focus on Scandinavian economic models.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P12_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it critiques socialist economic models (which aligns with the cluster's comparative analysis theme), it focuses on elite wealth concentration and political power dynamics rather than examining specific Nordic/Scandinavian economic policies and outcomes. The content about wealth-based elites actually has stronger thematic alignment with the alternative cluster on "Top 1% Wealth Concentration Trends" than with detailed Scandinavian economic model analysis.</div>

            <div class="title">3. Socialism’s future may lie in revisiting its roots, emphasizing radical democracy & social ownership, extending democratic rights into social & economic spheres, guaranteeing social rights & empowering individuals to reach their potential.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P8_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article focuses on broad theoretical concepts of socialism (radical democracy, social ownership, social rights) rather than the specific empirical analysis of Nordic/Scandinavian economic models that characterizes the cluster. While it discusses socialist principles, it lacks the comparative analysis with capitalist systems and concrete examination of Swedish, Finnish, or other Scandinavian experiences that define this subcluster's focus.</div>
