            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the intersection of tax policy and healthcare economics, focusing on how fiscal policies affect healthcare costs, pharmaceutical pricing, and health system financing. Articles analyze corporate tax strategies in pharmaceuticals, Medicare funding sustainability, and international comparisons of health spending efficiency. Common data sources include Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics, OECD healthcare metrics, and academic research on earnings variability and income inequality's health impacts. Unlike sibling subclusters that address broader economic performance or environmental trade-offs, this group specifically targets healthcare sector taxation, price controls, and the fiscal mechanisms underlying health systems across developed economies.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article focuses primarily on healthcare system capacity and staffing shortages in the UK's NHS rather than the intersection of tax policy and healthcare economics that defines the cluster. While healthcare financing is implicitly relevant, the article doesn't discuss fiscal policies, healthcare costs, or tax-related aspects of health system funding, making it a poor fit for a cluster specifically about tax policy and healthcare economics.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Tax Policy & Healthcare Economics" cluster because it focuses on broadband infrastructure and internet access speeds rather than fiscal policies, healthcare costs, or health system financing. The content about telecommunications infrastructure and international comparisons of broadband penetration has no apparent connection to tax policy or healthcare economics, making it a clear misclassification that would be better suited for the alternative cluster about innovation and productivity trends.</div>
