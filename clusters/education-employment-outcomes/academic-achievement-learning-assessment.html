            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster focuses on quantitative measurement and assessment of student learning outcomes through standardized testing and educational data analysis. Articles predominantly examine results from major assessment programs including NAEP, PISA, and OECD adult skills surveys, documenting declining test scores, widening achievement gaps, and international comparative performance. The content emphasizes data-driven analysis of educational effectiveness, chronic absenteeism rates, and learning loss trends, particularly post-pandemic impacts. Unlike other education subclusters that might focus on policy implementation or institutional factors, this grouping centers specifically on empirical measurement of academic achievement and skill assessment across different grade levels and demographic groups.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it presents quantitative educational assessment data (OECD Survey results comparing skill levels across countries), it focuses on adult skills rather than student learning outcomes, and emphasizes international comparative analysis rather than standardized testing methodology or educational data analysis techniques that typically characterize this cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it involves educational data analysis (fitting the cluster's focus on quantitative measurement), it measures general population reading habits rather than specific student learning outcomes or standardized test performance. The data tracks broader societal trends in reading behavior across all age groups rather than assessing academic achievement in educational settings, making it more aligned with demographic trend analysis than learning assessment.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S13</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it reports on standardized test scores (ACT), which fits the assessment focus of the cluster, it presents only a brief statistical update about declining scores rather than engaging in substantive analysis of learning outcomes or educational data interpretation. The article's superficial treatment of test score trends makes it almost equally relevant to discussions about elite college admissions, where ACT scores play a crucial gatekeeping role.</div>
