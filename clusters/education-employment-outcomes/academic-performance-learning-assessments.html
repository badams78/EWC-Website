            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster focuses on standardized test results and educational assessment data that measure student academic achievement across different grade levels and demographics. Articles predominantly analyze findings from major assessment programs like NAEP, PISA, and OECD surveys, documenting trends in reading and math proficiency, learning loss patterns, and international comparisons of educational outcomes. The content typically reports quantitative data showing declining test scores, achievement gaps, and concerning statistics about student performance below grade level. Coverage includes both national trends and state-by-state variations, often highlighting partisan differences in educational outcomes. Unlike broader education policy discussions, this subcluster specifically examines measurable learning outcomes through formal assessment data.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S8</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses assessment data measuring skills across populations (fitting the cluster's focus on educational assessments), it specifically examines adult workforce skills rather than student academic achievement across grade levels. The content is more aligned with how cognitive skills translate to economic performance in different countries, which better matches the alternative cluster about cognitive skills and economic returns.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses declining reading rates which could impact academic performance, it focuses on the general American population's leisure reading habits rather than specific educational assessments or standardized test results measuring student achievement. The data comes from a time-use survey about recreational activities rather than academic performance metrics, making it more aligned with broader social behavior trends than educational assessment outcomes.</div>

The content aligns more closely with standardized testing in the context of college admissions (the alternative cluster) since ACT scores are primarily used for college entrance rather than general academic performance measurement.</div>
