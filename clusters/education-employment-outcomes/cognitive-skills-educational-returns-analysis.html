            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the quantitative relationship between cognitive abilities and economic returns to education through empirical research. Articles analyze standardized test scores, IQ measurements, and longitudinal studies from sources like British birth cohorts, Norwegian military data, and Armed Forces aptitude tests. The focus is on measuring cognitive skill premiums, educational wage returns, and ability-earnings correlations across populations. Unlike sibling clusters examining performance gaps, admissions policies, or generational mobility, this subcluster specifically quantifies how measurable cognitive abilities translate into labor market outcomes, often finding substantial earnings premiums for higher cognitive skills and educational attainment.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P5_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions IQ as a cognitive measure (fitting the cluster's focus on cognitive abilities), its primary argument is about semiconductor manufacturing workforce constraints and technological growth rather than analyzing the quantitative relationship between cognitive skills and educational returns. The article's main focus on semiconductor talent shortages aligns more closely with the alternative "Semiconductor Supply Chain and Trade Policy" cluster, making it a weak fit for cognitive skills research.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions IQ measurements and test scores (fitting the cognitive skills theme), it focuses primarily on elite university admissions processes and how selection mechanisms affect student outcomes rather than analyzing the quantitative relationship between cognitive abilities and economic returns to education. The content is more aligned with understanding admissions dynamics at prestigious institutions than with measuring educational ROI based on cognitive metrics.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it examines educational outcomes (college graduation rates) and their quantitative effects, it focuses on health/mortality outcomes in geographic areas rather than cognitive abilities or economic returns to education. The study's emphasis on area-level educational composition and mortality rates aligns better with research on broader social and economic divides created by educational differences across regions.</div>
