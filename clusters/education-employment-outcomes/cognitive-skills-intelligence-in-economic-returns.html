            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the direct economic returns to cognitive abilities and intelligence measures in labor markets. Articles analyze longitudinal datasets from birth cohorts, military aptitude tests, and twin studies to quantify how cognitive skills translate into wages and career outcomes. Research focuses on measurable intelligence metrics like IQ scores, general mental ability tests, and standardized assessments, exploring their predictive power for earnings across different demographics and time periods. Unlike sibling subclusters that examine institutional factors like college admissions or broad educational attainment gaps, this collection specifically isolates cognitive capability as an independent variable driving economic success, often controlling for educational credentials to identify the pure returns to mental ability.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P5_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions IQ as a constraint for semiconductor manufacturing jobs, it focuses primarily on talent scarcity and technological/industrial capacity rather than analyzing the economic returns or wage premiums that high cognitive ability workers receive in labor markets. The article is more about supply chain constraints and industrial policy (hence its similarity to the semiconductor trade policy cluster) than about measuring how cognitive skills translate into economic outcomes for workers.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions IQ scores (a cognitive intelligence measure), it primarily focuses on college admissions testing and selection processes at elite institutions like Harvard, rather than examining the economic returns or labor market outcomes associated with cognitive abilities. The content aligns much better with standardized testing and elite admissions practices than with analyzing how intelligence translates into economic benefits in the workforce.</div>
