            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the quantitative relationship between cognitive abilities, intelligence measures, and educational returns in labor markets. Articles predominantly utilize longitudinal datasets, twin studies, military aptitude tests, and international comparative data to establish causal links between cognitive skills and earnings premiums. Research focuses on IQ correlations with educational attainment, social skills returns, and cross-national cognitive performance variations. Unlike sibling subclusters addressing demographic gaps or institutional factors, this collection emphasizes psychometric measurement and individual-level cognitive determinants of economic success, often drawing from behavioral economics and psychology literature to quantify talent constraints and skill premiums.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions IQ as a constraint for high-skilled semiconductor work, it focuses primarily on industry-specific talent limitations and technological constraints rather than examining the quantitative relationship between cognitive abilities and educational returns in labor markets. The content is more about semiconductor industry workforce requirements than the broader economic relationship between intelligence measures and educational outcomes that defines the cluster.</div>
