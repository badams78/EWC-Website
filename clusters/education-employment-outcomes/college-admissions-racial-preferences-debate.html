            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the contentious debate over race-conscious admissions policies in higher education and selective academic programs. Articles analyze statistical disparities in college enrollment by race, standardized test score distributions, and public opinion polling on affirmative action preferences. Data sources include university enrollment statistics, SAT/GCT performance metrics, legal challenges like Students for Fair Admissions cases, and survey research from Pew and YouGov. The content spans elite universities, military academies, and K-12 gifted programs, focusing specifically on policy debates around racial preferences in admissions. Unlike sibling subclusters that examine post-graduation outcomes or general academic performance trends, this group concentrates narrowly on the political and legal controversies surrounding race as an admissions factor, featuring both empirical enrollment data and normative public opinion research.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S10</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it involves a selective academic program that likely has racial enrollment disparities (fitting the "racial preferences debate" theme), it focuses specifically on early childhood education policy for kindergarteners rather than higher education admissions. The content is more naturally aligned with K-12 education policy discussions than college admissions debates, even though both topics intersect around issues of academic selectivity and equity.</div>
