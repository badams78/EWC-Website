            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines affirmative action policies and racial considerations in educational admissions, spanning from kindergarten gifted programs to elite universities and military academies. Articles analyze demographic enrollment patterns, test score distributions across racial groups, and public opinion on race-conscious admissions policies. Data sources include institutional enrollment statistics, standardized test results, polling data from organizations like Pew Research, and legal challenges from groups like Students for Fair Admissions. Unlike sibling clusters focusing on post-graduation outcomes or general achievement metrics, this subcluster specifically addresses the contentious intersection of race, merit, and access in educational gatekeeping mechanisms.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S10</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions a gifted program that likely has racial enrollment disparities (fitting the "racial considerations in educational admissions" theme), the article's primary focus is on a mayoral candidate's policy proposal to eliminate the program entirely, rather than discussing affirmative action policies or racial preferences in admissions. The content is more about educational policy change and political campaigning than about the racial dynamics of admissions processes that typically define this cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S13</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it focuses on mental health and financial stress among college students rather than racial preferences or affirmative action policies in admissions processes. While it involves an elite college (Dartmouth), the content is more aligned with student welfare and socioeconomic factors affecting academic performance rather than the racial considerations that define the assigned cluster.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "College Admissions & Racial Preferences" cluster because while it studies West Point (a military academy that could involve admissions considerations), it focuses entirely on gender integration effects rather than racial preferences or admissions policies. The study's emphasis on women's integration into military units and its impact on male soldiers' workplace perceptions aligns much better with gender-focused research than with racial affirmative action policies in education.</div>
