            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the evolving relationship between higher education credentials and labor market outcomes, focusing on employment rates, wage premiums, and job placement quality for college graduates. Articles analyze unemployment statistics, enrollment trends, and the diminishing value of college degrees in securing appropriate employment. Data sources include labor statistics, enrollment figures, and wage surveys tracking graduates aged 20-24. Unlike sibling clusters examining academic performance metrics or generational wealth patterns, this subcluster specifically quantifies the economic return on college investment and documents the convergence of employment outcomes between college and non-college workers, revealing challenges to traditional higher education value propositions.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S10</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "College Employment & Wage Premium Analysis" cluster because it focuses on the operational and quality impacts of free college policy (university rankings decline) rather than examining how college credentials translate to employment outcomes and wages for graduates. While it discusses higher education policy, it doesn't analyze the labor market returns or employment benefits that college education provides to students, which is the core focus of this cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S7</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses declining English major enrollment, it doesn't directly address the core cluster themes of employment rates, wages, or job market outcomes for graduates. The article focuses on enrollment trends rather than the economic returns or labor market performance that would clearly justify placement in the "Employment & Wage Premium Analysis" cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P1_S2</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions masters degrees (a higher education credential), its primary focus is on student debt regulation and university financing rather than analyzing employment outcomes, wage premiums, or labor market performance of college graduates. The article's emphasis on debt management and lending practices makes it more aligned with financial/banking topics than educational labor market analysis.</div>
