            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the effectiveness and impacts of early childhood through K-12 educational policies and interventions. It encompasses research on universal pre-K programs, charter schools, competitive academic programs, and specialized educational approaches, drawing from longitudinal studies, meta-analyses, and large-scale policy evaluations. Articles frequently analyze fade-out effects, differential outcomes across demographic groups, and cost-benefit assessments of educational investments. Unlike sibling clusters focused on performance metrics or demographic gaps, this subcluster specifically evaluates policy mechanisms and institutional reforms within primary and secondary education systems, emphasizing implementation outcomes rather than broader labor market or socioeconomic trends.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S8</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it relates to education by examining music training's cognitive effects, it's primarily a cognitive psychology study debunking perceived benefits rather than analyzing actual educational policies or interventions in K-12 settings. The research focuses on cognitive enhancement claims rather than evaluating how music education policies or programs impact student outcomes within educational systems.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P4_S2</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses childcare policy (which relates to early childhood), the primary focus is on labor market outcomes and cost-benefit analysis rather than educational policy impacts or child development outcomes that typically define K-12 education policy research. The article's emphasis on female labor supply and economic trade-offs aligns more closely with income support and labor policy analysis than with educational effectiveness studies.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S4</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses K-12 teacher compensation (which relates to education policy), it focuses primarily on comparative wage analysis between public and private school teachers rather than examining the effectiveness or impacts of specific educational policies or interventions. The content is more aligned with employment and wage analysis (hence the higher similarity to the alternative cluster) than with policy impact assessment, which is the core focus of the assigned cluster.</div>
