            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the effectiveness of specific educational policies and interventions through empirical evaluation. It encompasses early childhood programs like universal pre-K and Perry Preschool, institutional reforms such as charter schools and competitive hiring systems, and targeted interventions including music training and accelerated learning programs. Articles predominantly feature longitudinal studies, randomized controlled trials, and meta-analyses that measure intervention outcomes across diverse populations. Unlike sibling clusters that focus on achievement gaps, wage premiums, or mobility patterns, this subcluster specifically evaluates whether educational policies work as intended, often revealing mixed results and uneven benefits across demographic groups.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S8</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it evaluates the effectiveness of music training as an educational intervention (fitting the cluster's focus on empirical evaluation of educational programs), its primary emphasis is on debunking cognitive benefits rather than analyzing policy implementation or educational outcomes. The content aligns more closely with cognitive research methodology than educational policy effectiveness, making the alternative cluster about cognitive skills analysis a better fit.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P4_S2</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while Quebec's universal childcare policy is technically an early childhood intervention, the research focuses primarily on its economic impacts (labor market effects and cost-benefit analysis) rather than educational outcomes or child development effects that typically define educational interventions. The emphasis on labor supply and cost coverage aligns more closely with economic policy evaluation than educational policy effectiveness, making it a better fit for the income support policies cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S4</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses teacher compensation (which could relate to education policy), it primarily presents comparative wage data rather than evaluating the effectiveness of specific educational interventions or policies. The focus on salary comparisons between public and private school teachers aligns more closely with employment and wage analysis than with empirical assessment of educational program outcomes.</div>
