            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the relationship between elite college attendance, standardized testing, and economic outcomes. Articles analyze admissions policies at highly selective institutions, particularly focusing on SAT/ACT score requirements and their predictive value for academic success. Common data sources include longitudinal studies of Ivy-Plus colleges, public university admissions records, and standardized test performance by demographic groups. The research emphasizes how returns to elite education vary by student characteristics, with particular attention to differential outcomes for underrepresented minorities and students from less-educated families. Unlike sibling clusters that broadly examine educational attainment or general labor market outcomes, this subcluster specifically targets the premium associated with attending the most selective institutions and the role of academic merit measures in both admissions and subsequent career success.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S4</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions graduate school rankings (which relates to academic selection), its primary focus is on the economic returns and earnings outcomes of different graduate degrees rather than the admissions processes or access policies of elite institutions. The content aligns more closely with employment and wage premium analysis, as it specifically examines how school prestige translates to financial benefits across various professional fields.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses AP exam standards and their alignment with college performance (which relates to academic selection), it focuses primarily on standardized testing standards and grade inflation rather than elite college admissions policies or access to selective institutions.

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses standardized testing requirements at elite institutions (fitting the cluster's focus), it's a brief announcement about policy changes rather than an in-depth analysis of how these requirements relate to economic outcomes or broader admissions policies. The article's proximity to the "College Admissions & Racial Preferences" cluster suggests it may be more about admissions policy changes generally than the specific intersection of elite access, testing, and economic outcomes that defines this subcluster.</div>
