            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the economic returns and admissions processes of elite higher education institutions, with particular focus on standardized testing requirements and their predictive value. Articles typically analyze longitudinal datasets from Ivy-Plus colleges and selective universities, investigating how SAT/ACT scores correlate with academic outcomes and lifetime earnings. The research explores policy changes in test-optional admissions, differential returns by demographic groups, and the relationship between student quality metrics and institutional selectivity. Unlike sibling clusters focusing on broader educational attainment gaps or K-12 interventions, this subcluster specifically targets the intersection of elite college access, standardized assessment validity, and socioeconomic mobility through prestigious institution attendance.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S4</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions graduate school admissions indirectly through "school rank," its primary focus is on the economic returns and earnings outcomes of different graduate degrees rather than the admissions processes or standardized testing requirements that define the assigned cluster. The article aligns more closely with employment and wage analysis, which explains its higher similarity to the "College Graduate Employment & Wage Premiums" cluster.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it directly addresses standardized testing requirements at elite institutions (core to the cluster), it focuses narrowly on a policy announcement rather than examining the economic returns or predictive value of testing that defines the cluster's analytical focus. The mention of Yale's policy change could also relate to broader admissions policy debates, making it potentially relevant to the race-based admissions cluster as well.</div>
