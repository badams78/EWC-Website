            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the relationship between elite college admissions practices and subsequent student outcomes, focusing particularly on standardized testing requirements and selectivity effects. Articles analyze longitudinal data from Ivy-Plus institutions and selective universities to measure returns to college prestige after controlling for student quality metrics like SAT/ACT scores. Common themes include differential outcomes by race and socioeconomic background, with findings that elite college premiums persist for underrepresented minorities and first-generation students even after ability controls. Unlike sibling clusters examining broader educational trends or general employment outcomes, this subcluster specifically targets admissions policies at top-tier institutions and their causal effects on earnings and career trajectories, often using regression discontinuity designs around test score thresholds.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it examines outcomes from elite/selective graduate programs (which relates to selectivity effects), it focuses primarily on the economic returns and wage premiums of different degree types rather than admissions practices or undergraduate elite college outcomes.
