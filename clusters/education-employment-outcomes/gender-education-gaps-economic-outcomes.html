            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the intersection of gender disparities in educational attainment and their downstream economic consequences. Articles analyze how changing gender dynamics in college enrollment affect marriage patterns, wage gaps, and career trajectories across generations. Common data sources include longitudinal surveys, bank customer data, cross-country comparisons, and demographic studies spanning decades. The research emphasizes shifts from historical male educational advantages to contemporary female gains in higher education. Unlike sibling subclusters focusing on racial disparities or general academic achievement, this cluster specifically targets gender as the primary analytical lens, exploring how educational gender gaps translate into labor market outcomes, family formation patterns, and intergenerational mobility differences between men and women.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Gender Education Gaps & Economic Outcomes" cluster because it focuses narrowly on dating costs in NYC rather than examining gender disparities in education or their economic consequences. The article's content about recreational spending has no apparent connection to educational attainment gaps or gender-based economic outcomes, making it a clear misclassification that would be better suited for an economics or lifestyle cluster.</div>
