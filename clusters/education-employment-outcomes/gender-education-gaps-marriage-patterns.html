            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the intersection of educational attainment and relationship formation patterns, with particular focus on how gender disparities in college completion affect marriage markets and household formation. Articles analyze longitudinal demographic data spanning decades, customer account information from major financial institutions, and cross-national research to explore themes like assortative mating by education level, declining marriage rates among non-college populations, and evolving gender pay gaps. Unlike sibling subclusters that focus purely on academic performance or workplace dynamics, this group uniquely connects educational outcomes to intimate relationship patterns and family structure changes, incorporating both economic and sociological perspectives on how educational gender reversals reshape modern partnership formation.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses dating costs which could tangentially relate to relationship formation patterns, it focuses purely on the economics of dating in NYC rather than examining how educational attainment or gender disparities affect marriage markets. The content about expensive date costs has minimal connection to the cluster's core theme of education-marriage intersections, making it a poor fit despite the loose relationship context.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions "finding love" and relationship formation (which loosely connects to marriage patterns), it appears to be primarily about dating optimization strategies rather than examining the educational gender gaps and their impact on marriage markets that define this cluster.
