            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the intersection of educational attainment and romantic partnership patterns, focusing on how gender disparities in college completion affect marriage and dating markets. Articles analyze demographic trends using institutional data from sources like Bank of America, Danish administrative records, and longitudinal surveys spanning decades. The research reveals how educational sorting influences mate selection, with particular attention to declining marriage rates among non-college populations and changing gender dynamics in higher education. Unlike sibling clusters that focus on academic performance metrics or workplace wage premiums, this subcluster specifically explores how educational achievements translate into relationship outcomes and family formation patterns across different demographic groups.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses dating/romantic activities (the "cost of loving" for a night out), it focuses purely on economic aspects of dating rather than examining how gender gaps in education affect marriage and partnership patterns. The content is more about consumer economics and cost of living than the educational-marital outcome relationships that define the cluster's core theme.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions "finding love" and romantic selection processes that could relate to marriage outcomes, it appears to be about general dating advice or economic theories of mate selection rather than specifically examining gender disparities in education and how they affect marriage markets. The content seems more focused on optimization strategies (which aligns with the alternative "Management & Performance Analysis" cluster) rather than analyzing educational gender gaps and their impact on romantic partnerships.</div>
