            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines how different generations (Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X) experience varying economic trajectories over time, focusing on income growth patterns, wealth accumulation, and major financial milestones like homeownership. Articles typically analyze Federal Reserve data, longitudinal surveys, and demographic studies to compare generational cohorts at similar life stages. The research reveals complex patterns where younger generations may outpace predecessors in some metrics while facing unique challenges like student debt. Unlike sibling subclusters that focus on educational achievement measurement or workplace performance outcomes, this area specifically tracks long-term economic mobility across generational cohorts and life cycles.</p>
