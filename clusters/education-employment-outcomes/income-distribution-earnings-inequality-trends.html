            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines broad patterns in income distribution and earnings inequality across different demographic groups and time periods. Articles analyze long-term wage trends, particularly comparing outcomes between college-educated and non-college workers, generational wealth shifts, and earnings trajectories across income quintiles. Common data sources include Federal Reserve analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics longitudinal data, and academic research spanning 1960-2022. The focus emphasizes macroeconomic inequality trends rather than specific educational interventions or targeted demographic disparities, distinguishing it from subclusters examining particular populations or policy effectiveness.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S9</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it contains earnings data that relates to income distribution, its primary focus is on explaining family formation patterns rather than examining broad income inequality trends. The content is more specifically about the relationship between men's earnings capacity and marriage/family decisions, which aligns better with the gender and economic outcomes cluster that examines how demographic factors intersect with economic patterns.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P4_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions income inequality (a core topic of the assigned cluster), its primary focus is on work hours as a behavioral response to inequality rather than examining the actual patterns, trends, or distribution of income and earnings themselves. The article would fit better in the "Wage Growth and Earnings Trends" cluster since it analyzes how economic conditions (inequality) influence labor market behaviors rather than measuring inequality distributions.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses male earnings and family-supporting wages over time (fitting the income trends theme), it's primarily a brief social media reference to a policy debate rather than substantive analysis of income distribution patterns. The content appears more focused on specific policy arguments about wage adequacy and family support, which aligns better with the alternative cluster on income support policies.</div>
