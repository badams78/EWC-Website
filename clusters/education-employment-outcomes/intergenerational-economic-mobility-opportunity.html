            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines how economic advantages and disadvantages transfer across generations, focusing on intergenerational income mobility, wealth persistence, and factors that enable or constrain economic opportunity. Articles utilize longitudinal datasets spanning multiple generations, survey data like GSS and PSID, and demographic analyses to track families over time. Research encompasses geographic mobility effects, educational transmission mechanisms, and policy interventions that could break cycles of disadvantage. Unlike sibling clusters that focus on immediate educational or labor market outcomes, this subcluster takes a multigenerational view, examining how parental income, family structure, and regional factors shape children's long-term economic prospects and the persistence of economic inequality across family lineages.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P12_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it does examine wealth transmission across generations (fitting the intergenerational mobility theme), its primary focus is on demonstrating the lack of dynastic wealth persistence among the ultra-wealthy rather than examining the broader mechanisms of economic mobility or opportunity. The finding that over 90% of top 1% wealth holders' grandchildren don't maintain that status is more directly about wealth concentration patterns among elites than about general intergenerational economic mobility factors.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S9</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while geographic mobility can affect intergenerational economic opportunities (families moving for better jobs/schools), the article focuses primarily on demographic trends in interstate migration rather than directly examining how economic advantages transfer between generations. The content is more about population movement patterns and their causes (dual-earner households, aging) than about intergenerational wealth or income mobility specifically.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses social mobility (which relates to intergenerational opportunity), its primary focus is on how mobility patterns at the societal level influence attitudes toward immigrants rather than examining the mechanisms, factors, or outcomes of intergenerational economic mobility itself. The study treats mobility as an explanatory variable for social attitudes rather than as the main phenomenon being analyzed, which makes it more tangentially related to the cluster's core focus on understanding how economic advantages transfer across generations.</div>
