            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines how economic status transmits across generations, focusing on income mobility patterns and factors influencing economic progression over time. Articles utilize longitudinal datasets like PSID, multi-generational family data, and survey research to analyze whether children exceed their parents' income levels and what drives these outcomes. Research explores geographic mobility effects, educational attainment impacts, family structure influences, and wealth persistence among ultra-high earners. Unlike sibling clusters that focus on immediate educational performance or current labor market dynamics, this subcluster takes a longitudinal view spanning decades and generations to understand economic mobility trajectories and intergenerational economic relationships.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P12_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it touches on intergenerational economic transmission by examining wealth persistence across generations, its primary focus is on demonstrating the lack of dynastic wealth concentration among the ultra-wealthy rather than analyzing the broader patterns of income mobility and economic progression that characterize this cluster. The article would fit better in the "Top 1% Wealth Concentration Trends" cluster since it specifically examines wealth dynamics within the top 1% rather than general mobility patterns across income levels.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S9</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions factors like dual-earning couples that could indirectly affect intergenerational economic outcomes, its primary focus is on geographic mobility trends rather than the transmission of economic status between generations. The article's emphasis on interstate migration patterns and demographic factors like aging makes it more aligned with topics about household formation and mobility patterns than with studies examining how income and economic opportunities pass from parents to children.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions upward and downward mobility rates, its primary focus is on how these mobility patterns affect attitudes toward immigrants rather than examining the mechanisms or patterns of intergenerational economic progression itself. The study uses mobility data as an explanatory variable for social attitudes rather than analyzing mobility as the main phenomenon of interest, which makes it more aligned with research on labor market dynamics and social divisions.</div>
