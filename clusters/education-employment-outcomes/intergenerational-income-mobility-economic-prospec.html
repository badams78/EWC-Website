            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines how economic outcomes transmit across generations, focusing on intergenerational income mobility patterns and long-term economic prospects. Articles analyze multi-generational datasets spanning decades to centuries, tracking wealth persistence and mobility rates between parents and children. Research draws from longitudinal surveys like PSID and GSS, cross-national comparative studies, and historical records. Key themes include geographic influences on mobility, policy interventions affecting economic trajectories, and genetic factors in income outcomes. Unlike sibling subclusters that focus on immediate educational performance or current labor market conditions, this area specifically investigates the persistence or disruption of economic advantage across family lineages and generational wealth transmission mechanisms.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it does examine intergenerational wealth transmission (a key aspect of economic mobility), it focuses specifically on the ultra-wealthy top 1% rather than broader population mobility patterns that typically define intergenerational income mobility studies. The content is more aligned with wealth concentration dynamics among the highest earners, which explains why it shows higher similarity to the "Top Percentile Wealth Concentration Trends" cluster.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions economic factors affecting mobility patterns, it focuses on geographic/interstate migration rather than intergenerational income mobility or how economic outcomes transmit across generations.
