            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the interconnected relationship between educational credentials and workforce engagement, particularly focusing on declining participation rates among non-college workers. Articles analyze longitudinal employment data spanning 1980-2024, drawing from sources like the Global Flourishing Study, Federal Reserve research, and high-frequency labor statistics. Key themes include the widening employment gap between college and non-college workers, geographic disparities in job quality, mental health impacts of joblessness, and AI's displacement effects on knowledge work. Unlike sibling clusters examining academic performance metrics or wealth accumulation patterns, this subcluster emphasizes labor market dynamics and social factors driving workforce exits among prime-age populations.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while social capital can influence both educational outcomes and workforce participation patterns, the article focuses specifically on regional variations in social capital rather than directly examining the relationship between educational credentials and labor force engagement.
