            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines how educational attainment shapes employment outcomes, earnings trajectories, and broader socioeconomic well-being. Articles analyze labor force participation rates, wage gaps, and career prospects across education levels, particularly focusing on non-college workers' declining opportunities and social status. Research draws from longitudinal employment data, international comparative studies, and demographic surveys spanning 1980-2024. Unlike sibling clusters examining academic performance metrics or generational wealth patterns, this subcluster specifically connects educational credentials to labor market realities, exploring how technological change, geographic factors, and economic restructuring create divergent outcomes for college versus non-college populations in employment rates, job quality, and social mobility.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it focuses on regional variations in social capital rather than directly examining how educational attainment affects employment outcomes or earnings, which is the core theme of the assigned cluster. While social capital can influence labor market outcomes, the article's emphasis on geographic patterns of social trust and civic engagement aligns more closely with regional economic dynamics than with education-based employment analysis.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while cognitive difficulties can impact labor market performance and may correlate with education levels, the article specifically focuses on a health/cognitive decline phenomenon affecting the general prime-age population rather than examining how educational attainment directly shapes employment outcomes or earnings.

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses wage/job changes that likely correlate with education levels (middle vs. high-paid jobs), it focuses primarily on geographic and urban economic dynamics rather than explicitly analyzing how educational attainment drives these employment outcomes.
