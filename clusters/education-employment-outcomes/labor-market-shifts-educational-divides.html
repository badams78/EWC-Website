            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines how technological change and economic restructuring have created divergent labor market outcomes based on educational attainment. Articles analyze declining employment rates and social status among non-college workers, particularly young men, using longitudinal data from 1980-2024 spanning multiple countries. Research draws from employment surveys, housing data, and social capital measurements to document geographic and demographic disparities in job quality, wage premiums, and workforce participation. Unlike sibling clusters focusing on academic performance metrics or managerial effectiveness, this subcluster emphasizes structural economic shifts, social isolation, and the erosion of traditional career pathways for workers without higher education credentials.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses regional variations in social capital, it doesn't directly address labor market outcomes, educational divides, or employment patterns that define the assigned cluster. The content about geographic differences in social capital is more aligned with demographic and regional analysis rather than the specific focus on how education and technology create divergent workforce outcomes.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions labor market-relevant cognitive difficulties in the prime-age population, it focuses on documenting mental health/cognitive impairments rather than analyzing how educational divides or technological changes create different employment outcomes. The content aligns much better with the "Youth Mental Health & Mortality Crisis" cluster since it's fundamentally about documenting cognitive and concentration problems in the population, which are core mental health indicators.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses labor market changes and job polarization (which relates to educational divides), it focuses specifically on geographic differences between large and small cities rather than educational attainment patterns.
