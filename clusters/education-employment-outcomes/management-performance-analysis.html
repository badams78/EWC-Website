            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines management effectiveness and performance measurement across corporate and institutional contexts. Articles analyze managerial impact through empirical studies, market data, and organizational surveys, drawing on sources like Census Bureau management assessments, stock market analyses, and longitudinal corporate performance studies. The focus spans CEO selection processes, manager-performance correlations, compensation structures, and market volatility explanations. Unlike its sibling subcluster which centers on educational assessment metrics and student learning outcomes, this subcluster emphasizes workplace management dynamics, executive decision-making, and business performance indicators, connecting managerial quality to broader economic patterns and organizational success metrics.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P4_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions management roles and performance-based compensation, it focuses primarily on wage/salary increases and earning potential rather than analyzing management effectiveness or performance measurement methodologies. The content aligns more closely with compensation trends and career progression (wage growth) than with the analytical assessment of managerial performance that defines this cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S11</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while moral self-licensing has implications for managerial decision-making and could affect organizational performance, the article appears to focus primarily on the psychological phenomenon itself rather than empirically analyzing management effectiveness or performance measurement in corporate contexts. The content seems more aligned with psychological research methodology and behavioral studies, which explains its higher similarity to the Research Quality & Scientific Reproducibility cluster.</div>
