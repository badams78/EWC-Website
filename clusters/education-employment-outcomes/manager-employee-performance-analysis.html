            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines performance measurement and management effectiveness across corporate, financial, and labor market contexts. Articles analyze manager quality through experimental assignments, CEO selection processes, and compensation structures, while exploring employee performance patterns using statistical comparisons and behavioral studies. Data sources include US Census Bureau surveys, NBER research, stock market analysis from 1929-2022, and corporate case studies. Unlike its sibling subcluster focused on academic learning outcomes, this collection emphasizes workplace productivity, management practices, and market performance metrics, drawing connections between individual performance trends and broader economic patterns through empirical research and quantitative analysis.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P4_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions "top performers" and manager advancement from hourly roles, it focuses primarily on Walmart's compensation strategy and wage/salary structures rather than analyzing actual performance measurement systems, management effectiveness metrics, or how performance is evaluated. The content aligns more closely with wage and earnings trends, as it's fundamentally about how much managers can earn rather than how their performance is assessed or managed.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S11</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while moral self-licensing could theoretically affect manager and employee decision-making in workplace contexts, the article focuses on the broader psychological phenomenon and its general economic implications rather than specifically examining performance measurement, management effectiveness, or workplace performance analysis. The content is more aligned with psychological research methodology (hence the higher similarity to the replication crisis cluster) than with the concrete performance management topics that define this cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P7_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions analyzing poll results and methodology (which relates to performance measurement), it's specifically about political polling methodology rather than workplace or corporate performance analysis. The content is more aligned with political survey analysis and demographic preference gaps, which explains why it has higher similarity to the "Gender & Age Political Preference Gaps" cluster.</div>
