            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the relationship between managerial effectiveness and broader economic performance through empirical analysis of corporate and market data. Articles typically draw from large-scale datasets including US Census Bureau management surveys, S&P 500 earnings data, executive search studies, and longitudinal firm performance metrics spanning decades. The focus centers on quantifying management quality's impact on stock market volatility, firm valuations, and macroeconomic cycles, often using experimental or quasi-experimental methodologies. Unlike its sibling subcluster on Academic Achievement & Learning Assessment, which emphasizes educational institutions and student outcomes, this area concentrates on corporate leadership effectiveness and its transmission to market-level phenomena and economic stability.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P4_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions managerial performance incentives (bonuses tied to performance), it focuses primarily on compensation structure and wage levels rather than empirically analyzing the relationship between managerial effectiveness and market outcomes. The content is more aligned with wage/earnings trends, as it emphasizes salary figures, bonus percentages, and career progression paths rather than measuring actual managerial performance impacts on business results.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S11</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while moral self-licensing could theoretically influence managerial decision-making and thus affect market outcomes, the article appears to focus on the fundamental psychological phenomenon itself rather than empirically analyzing its specific relationship to managerial effectiveness or corporate performance data. The content seems more aligned with psychological research methodology and behavioral patterns rather than the cluster's emphasis on empirical analysis of managerial-market relationships using corporate data.</div>
