            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines race-conscious admissions policies in higher education and K-12 programs, analyzing both implementation outcomes and public sentiment. Articles frequently cite demographic enrollment data from elite universities like Harvard and Stanford, standardized test score distributions by race, and public opinion polling from sources like Pew Research and YouGov. The content spans legal challenges to affirmative action, academic performance metrics, and political campaigns targeting gifted programs. Unlike sibling clusters focused on economic outcomes or performance trends, this subcluster specifically addresses policy debates around racial preferences in educational access, documenting both statistical impacts and evolving public attitudes toward race-based admissions practices.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it touches on a gifted and talented program that may have racial equity implications (a topic relevant to race-based admissions discussions), it primarily focuses on a specific K-12 education policy proposal by a mayoral candidate rather than directly examining race-conscious admissions policies or public opinion about them. The content is more naturally aligned with general education policy debates than with the specific focus on race-based admissions and associated public sentiment that defines this cluster.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article focuses specifically on mental health outcomes and financial stress among college students at Dartmouth, which relates more directly to student wellbeing and outcomes rather than race-based admissions policies or public opinion about such policies.
