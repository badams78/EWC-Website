            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines racial disparities in economic mobility and employment outcomes through empirical research and policy analysis. Articles predominantly feature Raj Chetty's influential mobility research alongside studies using tax records, W-2 data, and labor statistics from 1998-2024. The focus centers on intergenerational income gaps between racial groups, with particular attention to black-white opportunity differences and immigration effects. Unlike sibling clusters examining general academic performance or wage premiums, this subcluster specifically investigates how race intersects with economic advancement, featuring prominent economists' work on structural barriers, unemployment trends, and skill gaps that perpetuate inequality across generations.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P8_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Racial & Economic Opportunity Gaps" cluster because it focuses on philosophical arguments about systemic racism and black agency rather than the empirical research on economic mobility and employment outcomes that characterizes the cluster. The piece appears to be more of a theoretical/ideological commentary on racism and historical civil rights measures rather than data-driven analysis of racial economic disparities.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P7_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article focuses on interracial marriage trends rather than economic mobility or employment disparities, which are the core themes of the "Racial & Economic Opportunity Gaps" cluster. While interracial marriage could theoretically relate to racial economic outcomes, the article doesn't discuss economic factors and is more about demographic/social trends, making it a poor fit for a cluster centered on economic opportunity research.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P12_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses wealth inequality and intergenerational persistence of economic advantage (relevant to economic opportunity gaps), it focuses on historical wealth concentration among the top 10% rather than examining racial disparities in economic mobility or employment outcomes through empirical research. The content aligns more closely with wealth concentration trends than with the cluster's emphasis on racial mobility gaps and policy analysis.</div>
