            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines economic disparities across racial and ethnic groups, focusing on employment rates, wage gaps, and intergenerational mobility differences. Articles predominantly analyze empirical research using tax data, labor statistics, and longitudinal studies, particularly citing work by Raj Chetty and other economists. Coverage spans manufacturing job losses affecting Black workers, immigrant earnings patterns, interracial marriage trends, and unemployment rate variations by race. Unlike sibling subclusters that focus on educational achievement metrics or specific demographic segments, this cluster emphasizes systemic economic inequalities and their underlying causes, incorporating both quantitative analyses and policy debates about discrimination versus skill gaps.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P8_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it focuses on philosophical arguments about systemic racism and black agency rather than empirical analysis of economic disparities like employment rates, wage gaps, or intergenerational mobility that characterize the cluster. The piece appears to be more of a theoretical/political commentary on racial issues rather than an examination of concrete economic data across racial and ethnic groups.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Racial & Ethnic Economic Disparities" cluster because it focuses on interracial marriage trends rather than economic disparities like employment rates, wage gaps, or economic mobility between racial groups. While interracial marriage patterns can have economic implications, the article's primary focus is demographic rather than economic, making it only tangentially related to the cluster's core theme of racial and ethnic economic differences.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Racial & Ethnic Economic Disparities" cluster because while it discusses wealth inequality in the post-Civil War South (which had significant racial implications), it focuses primarily on the persistence of wealth concentration among former slaveholders rather than explicitly analyzing racial or ethnic economic gaps. The content aligns more closely with wealth concentration patterns among elites, making the "Top 1% Wealth and Income Concentration" cluster a better fit.</div>
