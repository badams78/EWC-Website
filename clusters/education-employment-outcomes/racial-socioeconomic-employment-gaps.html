            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines employment disparities across racial and socioeconomic lines, analyzing wage gaps, unemployment rates, and career outcomes for different demographic groups. Articles frequently cite research from economists like Raj Chetty and utilize large-scale datasets including tax records, W-2 data, and labor statistics spanning multiple decades. The focus centers on quantifying employment inequalities, exploring their underlying causes—from educational differences to potential discrimination—and tracking how economic conditions like tight labor markets affect various groups differently. Unlike sibling clusters that examine academic performance metrics or intergenerational wealth transfers, this subcluster specifically targets current labor market participation and employment quality disparities, often highlighting how structural factors impact minority and lower-income workers' economic opportunities.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions systemic racism (which relates to racial disparities), it focuses on philosophical arguments about agency and historical civil rights measures rather than concrete employment data, wage gaps, or workplace outcomes that define the cluster's core focus. The content is more about ideological debate than empirical analysis of employment disparities across demographic groups.</div>
