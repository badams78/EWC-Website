            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines methodological issues and credibility challenges within academic research that informs education and employment policy. Articles focus on replication crises, research misconduct, publication bias, and factors that compromise scientific integrity. Common themes include retraction rates, failed replications, statistical manipulation, and the politicization of research findings. Data sources include meta-analyses of academic publications, citation studies, and grant funding research. Unlike sibling subclusters that analyze specific educational or employment outcomes, this group critiques the research infrastructure itself, questioning the reliability of studies that underpin policy decisions and highlighting systemic problems in peer review and academic incentives.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P7_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it presents research findings about social dynamics, it doesn't actually discuss methodological issues, replication problems, or credibility challenges in the research itself - it simply reports on diversity's effects on social capital. The content is more aligned with demographic and political trends rather than examining the reliability or scientific consensus issues surrounding such research.</div>

            <div class="title">2. The inspection paradox distorts sample data by overrepresenting larger groups, leading to biased averages: e.g., average class sizes appear 90 vs. an actual 35, and prison sentences average 13 years vs. an actual 3.6 years, skewing perceptions.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses a statistical methodology issue (inspection paradox) that could affect research reliability, it focuses more on a specific sampling bias rather than broader scientific consensus challenges or research misconduct. The content is more about understanding a particular statistical phenomenon and its real-world implications rather than examining systemic problems with research credibility or replication crises.</div>
