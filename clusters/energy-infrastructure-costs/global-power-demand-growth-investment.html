            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the rapid expansion of global electricity demand driven by datacenter growth, renewable energy transition, and industrial electrification. Articles feature quantitative forecasts from organizations like IEA and Goldman Sachs, tracking metrics such as generation capacity additions, investment flows, and demand growth rates across major economies. The content emphasizes China's massive infrastructure buildout versus slower US transmission development, while analyzing how carbon reduction policies influence industrial competitiveness. Unlike the sibling subcluster focusing on US energy production and trade flows, this cluster takes a broader international perspective on power sector investment trends and infrastructure capacity planning.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while Amazon's $148B data center investment will significantly contribute to global power demand growth (fitting the assigned cluster), the focus is primarily on the capital expenditure figure itself rather than the electricity demand implications, making it equally relevant to the "AI Capital Expenditure and Investment Metrics" cluster which directly tracks major tech investment spending.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P14_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it provides regional statistics on air conditioning penetration rates that could relate to electricity demand growth, it lacks the forward-looking quantitative forecasts and focus on emerging drivers like datacenters, renewables, and industrial electrification that characterize the cluster. The static 2016 household data is more descriptive than predictive, making it only tangentially related to the subcluster's emphasis on rapid demand expansion and investment trends.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P11_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions AI servers' electricity consumption growth (fitting the "datacenter growth" aspect of the cluster), it provides a narrow, specific statistic about one technology rather than examining the broader "rapid expansion of global electricity demand" from multiple drivers like renewable transition and industrial electrification that defines this cluster. The focus on AI computational infrastructure makes it nearly as relevant to the AI Performance cluster, which likely discusses the scaling and resource requirements of AI systems.</div>
