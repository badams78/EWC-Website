            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster focuses on the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak's escalation and public health implications, tracking viral transmission patterns across animal populations and human cases. Articles predominantly feature epidemiological data from CDC analyses, WHO assessments, and surveillance reports documenting viral spread through dairy cattle, poultry, and emerging human infections. Content emphasizes genomic sequencing results, serological surveys, and variant identification like the D1.1 strain. Unlike sibling subclusters examining energy production dynamics or infrastructure investments, this collection prioritizes infectious disease monitoring, zoonotic transmission pathways, and pandemic preparedness concerns within agricultural sectors.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the H5N1 Bird Flu cluster because while it involves a zoonotic disease outbreak with significant public health implications, it describes an unidentified illness in the Democratic Republic of Congo rather than the specific H5N1 avian influenza strain that defines the cluster. The outbreak shares similar characteristics (animal-to-human transmission, public health concern) but involves a different pathogen and geographic region than the H5N1 focus.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses avian flu (H5N1), it focuses primarily on the agricultural and economic impact of bird culls rather than the public health implications and human transmission patterns that define the cluster's core focus. The article lacks discussion of human cases, viral transmission to humans, or broader public health concerns, making it more about agricultural disease management than the health crisis aspect emphasized in the cluster definition.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it directly reports on H5N1 bird flu findings from the CDC, it focuses specifically on a limited serologic survey of dairy workers rather than the broader outbreak escalation and transmission patterns across animal populations that characterize the main cluster theme. The relatively narrow scope of studying occupational exposure in one specific worker group makes it less representative of the cluster's emphasis on widespread viral transmission patterns and broader public health implications.</div>
