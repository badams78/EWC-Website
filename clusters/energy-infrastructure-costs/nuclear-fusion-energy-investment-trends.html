            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines private and public investment flows into advanced nuclear technologies, including both traditional nuclear power and emerging fusion energy ventures. Articles analyze cost comparisons between energy sources, highlighting nuclear's high capital costs versus gas alternatives, while tracking substantial private funding rounds for fusion startups like Helion and Commonwealth Fusion Systems. Coverage includes government policy initiatives, international spending patterns, and technological milestones from companies achieving plasma breakthroughs. Unlike sibling subclusters focused on broader energy trade or general power demand, this group specifically targets investment trends, regulatory changes, and financial backing driving nuclear innovation, incorporating geothermal storage solutions as complementary carbon-free technologies.</p>
