            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster focuses on empirical climate data documenting unprecedented changes in ocean temperatures, ice loss, and marine ecosystems. Articles predominantly cite scientific research from Nature, NOAA, and climate monitoring institutions, presenting quantitative evidence of record-breaking ocean temperatures, accelerating glacier retreat, and expanding marine heatwaves. The content emphasizes observable climate impacts through statistical trends and measurements. Unlike sibling subclusters examining energy production dynamics or technological solutions, this grouping centers on environmental monitoring data that demonstrates the physical consequences of climate change, particularly oceanic and cryospheric systems responding to global warming patterns.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P3_S7</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it documents unprecedented climate-driven changes using Nature research (fitting the cluster's focus on empirical climate data), it specifically concerns Alpine snowpack rather than ocean temperatures and marine ecosystems. The content about water resources from snowpack decline makes it more aligned with the alternative "Water Infrastructure & Resource Management" cluster.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it focuses on Arctic land temperatures and wildfire impacts rather than ocean temperature records or marine ecosystem changes, which are the core themes of this cluster. While Arctic warming can indirectly affect ocean temperatures through ice melt and regional climate systems, the article's primary emphasis on terrestrial wildfires and land-based temperature records makes it a better fit for a different cluster focused on broader climate impacts or regional warming patterns.</div>
