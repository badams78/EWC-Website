            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P3_S2</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions a quantum computing breakthrough by Microsoft, the brief description lacks specific technical details about quantum computing technology, hardware developments, or competitive positioning that would strongly anchor it to the quantum computing cluster. The generic phrasing about "technical breakthrough" and "scalable quantum computers" makes it equally suitable for the broader "Scientific Research & Technological Breakthroughs" category, which could encompass any major tech advancement.</div>
