            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster encompasses fundamental scientific discoveries and technological breakthroughs across diverse research domains, from CRISPR gene editing and AI-driven protein design to cosmic ray physics and asteroid detection. Articles typically report on academic research findings, featuring perspectives from university researchers, tech companies like Google DeepMind, and space agencies. The content focuses on cutting-edge methodologies and novel discoveries rather than practical applications. Unlike its sibling subclusters which examine energy production economics and market dynamics, this group emphasizes the scientific foundations that may eventually transform energy technologies, representing the research pipeline feeding future infrastructure innovations.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions NASA's DART experiment (which represents a technological breakthrough in asteroid defense), the primary focus is on asteroid threat assessment and planetary defense rather than fundamental scientific research or discovery.

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is about macroeconomic conditions (growth, inflation, labor markets, business investment) rather than scientific discoveries or technological breakthroughs, making it completely unrelated to the assigned cluster's focus on research advances like CRISPR and AI-driven protein design. The article appears to be misclassified and would be better suited for an economics or business news cluster rather than any technology-focused category.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it reports on a significant scientific discovery about anti-aging treatment, it focuses narrowly on a single biological mechanism (IL-11 inhibition) rather than representing the broader scope of "fundamental scientific discoveries and technological breakthroughs across diverse research domains" that characterizes the cluster. The finding, though important, lacks the interdisciplinary breadth or technological innovation typical of major scientific breakthroughs that would strongly align with this cluster's centroid.</div>
