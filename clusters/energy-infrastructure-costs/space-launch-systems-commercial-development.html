            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster focuses on the commercial space industry's rapid development, covering private launch systems, satellite constellations, and lunar exploration missions. Articles primarily track SpaceX's Starship testing program, Blue Origin's achievements, and emerging competitors like Firefly Aerospace, emphasizing financial performance metrics, technical milestones, and market valuations. Content sources include aerospace industry reports, financial filings, and mission updates. Unlike sibling clusters examining terrestrial energy infrastructure or health crises, this subcluster analyzes space-based commercial ventures as emerging economic sectors, highlighting revenue generation from satellite services, spectrum allocations, and the growing privatization of space exploration activities.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P5_S6</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Space Launch Systems & Commercial Development" cluster because it focuses on a government space agency achievement (India's lunar landing) rather than commercial space activities, and it emphasizes scientific exploration of the Moon's South Pole rather than the private launch systems and commercial ventures that define the cluster. While lunar exploration is mentioned in the cluster description, the article lacks any connection to the commercial space industry or private companies that are the primary focus of this subcluster.</div>

        <li>
            <div class="title">2. New @NBERpubs paper finds that there is no empirical evidence that government spending related to the space race contributed to excess economic growth on the national level.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P6_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses space-related government spending, it focuses on economic analysis rather than the technical development of launch systems or commercial space ventures that define the cluster. The content is more aligned with economic research on productivity and technology investment impacts, which explains its higher similarity to the alternative cluster about productivity growth.</div>

        <li>
            <div class="title">3. In 2024, commercial filings for lunar telecommunications spectrum outpaced those from governments for the first time according to an FT analysis.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P5_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions commercial space activity (lunar telecommunications), it focuses specifically on regulatory/spectrum filing trends rather than the physical launch systems, satellite deployments, or mission developments that typically define this cluster. The piece is more about telecommunications regulation and market dynamics than the hardware and operational aspects of commercial space development that characterize the subcluster's focus on SpaceX and launch systems.</div>
