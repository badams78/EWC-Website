            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines water infrastructure development, resource allocation, and scarcity challenges across regional and global scales. Articles analyze government water policies, interstate allocation agreements, groundwater depletion impacts on agriculture, and climate-driven supply stress. Data sources include Federal Reserve analyses, regional water authority reports, and agricultural impact studies. Coverage spans major infrastructure projects like China's Yarlung Tsangpo dam alongside localized pricing and allocation issues in the US Southwest. Unlike sibling subclusters focused on energy production or technological breakthroughs, this examines water as both a critical resource and infrastructure challenge requiring policy intervention and economic trade-offs.</p>

            <div class="title">1. Construction has started on a $167B (2.2% of China's 2024 GDP) Yarlung Tsangpo river dam. The project could generate ~ 300 terawatt-hours a year or about the UK’s total annual electricity use and increase GDP by 0.1–0.2 pp.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P3_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it involves water infrastructure (a massive dam project), its primary focus is on electricity generation capacity and economic impact rather than water resource management, allocation, or scarcity issues. The emphasis on power output (300 terawatt-hours) and GDP growth makes it more aligned with energy infrastructure and power generation than traditional water resource management concerns.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions water pricing in Arizona, it focuses primarily on the economic/market aspect of rising costs rather than the infrastructure development, resource allocation policies, or management strategies that define the cluster. The content is more about price trends and affordability impacts (hence its similarity to the housing market cluster) rather than the technical or policy aspects of water infrastructure and resource management.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions rainfall patterns that relate to water resource availability, it primarily focuses on documenting climate-driven precipitation extremes rather than discussing water infrastructure systems, policy decisions, or resource management strategies. The content appears more aligned with climate impact studies (hence the higher similarity to the ocean temperature cluster) than with the practical aspects of water infrastructure and resource allocation that define this cluster.</div>
