            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the rapidly accelerating global electricity demand driven by digitalization, industrial growth, and energy transition. Articles focus on quantitative projections showing 40-50% demand growth by 2035, with particular emphasis on data center power consumption and renewable energy deployment. Content draws from industry forecasts, government statistics, and investment analyses, comparing regional approaches especially between China's massive capacity additions and US infrastructure investment patterns. Unlike sibling subclusters focused on US energy production leadership, this collection emphasizes demand-side pressures and the infrastructure investment response across global markets, highlighting the gap between projected electricity needs and current grid capacity expansion rates.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P11_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while Amazon's massive $148B data center investment will significantly drive electricity demand growth (fitting the assigned cluster), the focus is primarily on the capital expenditure aspect of data center infrastructure rather than the electricity demand implications. The article's emphasis on investment spending aligns more closely with the "AI Capital Expenditure and Investment Surge" cluster, though the underlying infrastructure will certainly contribute to the global electricity demand trends discussed in the assigned cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P14_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it provides statistical data on air conditioning penetration rates across major economies, it focuses on static household equipment ownership rather than dynamic electricity demand growth projections or investment trends that define the cluster. The article lacks the forward-looking quantitative analysis of electricity consumption patterns and growth drivers that characterize other articles in this cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P11_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions electricity demand from AI servers, it focuses narrowly on quantifying AI's specific energy consumption rather than examining the broader global electricity demand trends driven by digitalization, industrial growth, and energy transition that define the cluster. The article's tight focus on AI energy usage makes it more aligned with AI-specific discussions (like the alternative cluster about AI performance plateaus) rather than comprehensive analysis of global electricity demand patterns.</div>
