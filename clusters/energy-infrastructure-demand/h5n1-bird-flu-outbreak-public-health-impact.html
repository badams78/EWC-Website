            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster focuses on the ongoing H5N1 avian influenza outbreak and its expanding public health implications. Articles predominantly track disease surveillance data from CDC and WHO, documenting viral spread across species barriers from wild birds to dairy cattle, pigs, and humans. Coverage emphasizes epidemiological analysis, genomic sequencing results, and mortality statistics, with particular attention to new viral variants like D1.1 and transmission patterns among agricultural workers. Unlike sibling subclusters examining energy production capacity or technological innovation, this collection centers on infectious disease monitoring and outbreak response, connecting to energy infrastructure through potential impacts on agricultural supply chains and economic stability during health emergencies.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it involves WHO health surveillance and outbreak monitoring (consistent with the H5N1 cluster's focus on disease tracking), it discusses a completely different pathogen - an unidentified illness in Congo rather than H5N1 avian influenza. The article shares the public health surveillance framework but lacks any connection to bird flu, making it thematically misaligned with the cluster's specific focus on H5N1 outbreak tracking.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it focuses narrowly on poultry culling statistics and agricultural impacts of avian flu, rather than the public health surveillance data, disease monitoring, and human health implications that define the cluster's core focus. While it addresses the same H5N1 outbreak, it approaches it from an economic/agricultural perspective rather than the public health angle emphasized by CDC and WHO surveillance data that characterizes the cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it directly reports CDC surveillance data on H5N1 infections in humans (perfectly matching the cluster's focus), the brief, data-heavy format and mention of population-level prevalence studies might superficially resemble demographic health trend reporting. However, the content is clearly about avian influenza outbreak surveillance rather than general youth demographics, making the low similarity score likely due to formatting or keyword matching issues rather than true topical mismatch.</div>
