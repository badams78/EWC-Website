            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the resurgence of nuclear power and breakthrough developments in fusion technology as critical components of future energy infrastructure. Articles analyze cost comparisons between nuclear, gas, and renewable technologies, highlighting nuclear's current $15/watt disadvantage versus $1/watt alternatives. Coverage includes private fusion investment trends, with companies like Helion and Commonwealth Fusion Systems securing billions in funding, alongside geothermal innovations from firms like Fervo. Content draws from industry reports, government policy announcements, and startup funding data. Unlike sibling clusters focused on conventional energy exports or broad electricity demand, this subcluster specifically tracks emerging nuclear technologies and their commercial viability timelines.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P3_S7</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it focuses on geothermal energy storage rather than nuclear or fusion technology, making it a poor fit for the assigned cluster despite both being clean energy topics. The content about geothermal power plants and energy storage is more aligned with alternative energy infrastructure than with nuclear/fusion developments, explaining why it has higher similarity to the Water Resource Management cluster.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions a nuclear facility, it primarily focuses on cost overruns and declining investor sentiment rather than examining nuclear technology breakthroughs, fusion developments, or the strategic role of nuclear power in future energy infrastructure. The emphasis on financial challenges and reduced investment interest aligns more closely with broader electricity sector investment trends than with technological advancement in nuclear and fusion technologies.</div>
