            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions a Microsoft quantum computing breakthrough, it lacks specific technical details about the hardware components or algorithmic advances that typically define this cluster. The generic description of a "technical breakthrough" without mentioning quantum processors, error correction, qubit architectures, or specific algorithmic improvements makes it less clearly aligned with the cluster's focus on detailed technological developments.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P5_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses a quantum computing algorithmic breakthrough (breaking RSA encryption), it focuses more on the practical limitations and skepticism around the achievement rather than celebrating genuine hardware or algorithmic advances like the typical breakthrough announcements from major tech companies. The article's emphasis on the algorithm potentially not being "fast enough to be relevant" suggests it's more about questioning claimed progress rather than reporting on substantial technological advancement.</div>
