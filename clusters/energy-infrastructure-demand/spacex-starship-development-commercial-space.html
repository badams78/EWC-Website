            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster centers on commercial space industry developments, particularly SpaceX's Starship program and broader private space ventures. Articles track rocket test launches, technical failures and successes, financial valuations, and revenue metrics from companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Firefly Aerospace. Coverage includes lunar missions, satellite deployment statistics, telecommunications spectrum filings, and emerging space infrastructure. Unlike sibling subclusters focused on terrestrial energy production or traditional electricity demand, this examines space-based economic activity as emerging infrastructure. Articles blend technical aerospace reporting with financial analysis, emphasizing commercial viability rather than government programs, positioning space technology as a new frontier for energy and communications infrastructure investment.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the SpaceX Starship cluster because while it involves space exploration, it focuses on India's government space program rather than commercial space ventures or SpaceX specifically. The article discusses a lunar landing achievement by a national space agency, which doesn't align with the cluster's emphasis on private commercial space industry developments and SpaceX's Starship program.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses space-related spending, it focuses on historical economic analysis of government space programs rather than current commercial space developments like SpaceX's Starship program that define the cluster. The article's emphasis on economic research methodology and findings about government spending effects aligns more closely with the alternative cluster about innovation and investment-driven productivity trends.</div>
