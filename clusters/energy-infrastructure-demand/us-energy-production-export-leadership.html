            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster focuses on America's emergence as a dominant global energy exporter, tracking record-breaking domestic production levels, massive pipeline infrastructure expansion, and the geopolitical implications of US energy leadership. Articles predominantly feature quantitative data from government energy statistics, trade reports, and industry surveys, particularly emphasizing export revenues, production milestones, and infrastructure investments. The content contrasts US energy abundance with traditional producers like Saudi Arabia facing budget deficits and examines how American energy dominance reshapes global supply chains and international relationships, especially amid geopolitical tensions affecting traditional energy corridors.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it focuses on Germany's LNG import infrastructure rather than US energy production or export capabilities, making it geographically misaligned with the cluster's emphasis on American energy dominance. While LNG imports could indirectly relate to global energy trade that might involve US exports, the article's primary focus on German infrastructure development doesn't directly support the cluster's core theme of US energy production and export leadership.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it focuses on Saudi Arabia's petrodollar recycling and sovereign wealth fund management rather than US energy production or export activities. While it touches on energy-related financial flows, it's more about international monetary dynamics and currency circulation patterns, which aligns better with the "Trade Balances and Currency Dynamics" cluster.</div>
