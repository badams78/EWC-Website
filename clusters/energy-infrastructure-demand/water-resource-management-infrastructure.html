            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines water resource availability, infrastructure development, and management challenges across regional and global scales. Articles analyze water supply trends using government data and research studies, particularly focusing on groundwater depletion, regional water stress patterns, and climate-driven supply changes. Coverage spans major infrastructure projects like China's massive dam construction, interstate water allocation agreements in the US Southwest, and rising water costs in drought-prone regions. Unlike sibling clusters focused on energy production or technology breakthroughs, this subcluster emphasizes water as both a critical resource constraint and infrastructure investment priority, documenting how water scarcity increasingly shapes economic and policy decisions across different geographic regions and agricultural systems.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P3_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions a dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo river, the primary focus is on the massive electricity generation capacity (300 TWh annually) and economic impact rather than water resource management, infrastructure challenges, or water supply trends. The emphasis on power generation output and GDP effects aligns more closely with electricity infrastructure and energy investment themes than water resource management.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions water pricing in Arizona, it focuses primarily on the economic aspect of rising water costs rather than the technical infrastructure development, resource management strategies, or supply availability analysis that characterizes the core cluster content. The article's emphasis on price trends and market dynamics aligns more closely with economic analysis than with water resource management and infrastructure development.</div>
