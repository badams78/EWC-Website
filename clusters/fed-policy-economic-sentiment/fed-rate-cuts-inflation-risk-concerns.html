            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting cycle and associated inflation risks, featuring analyses of bond yield movements, monetary policy effectiveness, and historical parallels to inflationary periods like the 1970s. Articles draw on economic models, market data, and academic research to assess whether aggressive rate cuts amid economic strength could reignite inflation. Coverage includes technical analysis of yield curves, consumer sentiment studies, and warnings from economists about asymmetric inflation risks. Unlike its sibling focusing on income-inflation disparities affecting consumers, this subcluster emphasizes monetary policy mechanics and macroeconomic risks from a policy and market perspective.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Fed Rate Cuts & Inflation Risk Concerns" cluster because while it discusses pricing mechanisms and market dynamics that relate to inflation concerns, it focuses specifically on price-gouging and competitive supply responses rather than Federal Reserve monetary policy or rate cuts. The content is more aligned with general market pricing theory and supply-demand economics than the Fed's specific policy tools and inflation management strategies that define the cluster.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Fed Rate Cuts & Inflation Risk Concerns" cluster because while it discusses government economic policy impacts that could inform monetary policy decisions, it focuses on long-term structural effects of government spending on growth rather than the Federal Reserve's specific rate-cutting policies and inflation dynamics.
