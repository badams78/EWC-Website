            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines Federal Reserve interest rate decisions through the lens of inflation risk assessment and monetary policy effectiveness. Articles analyze yield curve dynamics, natural rate models, and historical parallels to inflationary periods like the 1970s. Common sources include Fed policy analysis, academic research on political pressures on monetary policy, and market commentary on rate cutting cycles. The focus centers on whether current monetary policy stance adequately addresses inflation risks versus economic growth needs. Unlike its sibling subcluster on income growth versus inflation dynamics, this group emphasizes institutional policy mechanisms and forward-looking risk assessment rather than household-level economic impacts.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses price dynamics and profit mechanisms that can influence inflation, it focuses on microeconomic price theory and market competition rather than Federal Reserve monetary policy or interest rate decisions.

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Fed Rate Policy & Inflation Risk Assessment" cluster because while it analyzes macroeconomic factors that could influence monetary policy decisions (government size and economic growth), it doesn't directly address Federal Reserve interest rate policy or inflation risk assessment.

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Fed Rate Policy & Inflation Risk Assessment" cluster because while it discusses an economic rescue package that could have inflationary implications (which would be relevant to Fed policy considerations), the content focuses primarily on the tax policy aspects and wealth distribution effects rather than analyzing Federal Reserve decisions, interest rates, or inflation risk assessment. The article's emphasis on tax breaks for wealthy individuals and corporations aligns much more closely with tax policy analysis than with monetary policy or Fed rate decisions.</div>
