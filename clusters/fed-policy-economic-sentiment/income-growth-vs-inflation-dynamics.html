            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the complex relationship between income growth and inflation pressures, focusing on how different economic groups experience varying impacts from price changes and wage dynamics. Articles analyze real wage trends, spending patterns across income quintiles, and the divergent effects of inflation on household finances. Common data sources include Federal Reserve analysis, bank internal spending data from JPM and BAC, and economic research from figures like Krugman and Zandi. The content emphasizes empirical analysis of consumer behavior, wealth distribution effects, and sector-specific price movements. Unlike broader Fed policy discussions, this subcluster specifically dissects the microeconomic transmission mechanisms between monetary policy outcomes and household-level financial realities across different socioeconomic strata.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P12_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it touches on income differences across economic groups (which relates to inflation dynamics), it primarily focuses on consumption and saving patterns across wealth quintiles rather than examining how income growth interacts with inflation pressures. The content is more closely aligned with wealth concentration analysis, as evidenced by its higher similarity to the "Top 1% Wealth Concentration Trends" cluster, since it specifically examines behavioral differences between wealth quintiles rather than inflation-income dynamics.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P0_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while current-account surpluses can influence domestic inflation through increased money supply and purchasing power, the article focuses primarily on Asia's trade balance dynamics rather than the direct relationship between income growth and inflation pressures within economies. The content aligns much better with "Currency and Trade Balance Dynamics" since it specifically discusses current-account surpluses, which are fundamentally about trade flows and international financial positions rather than domestic wage-price relationships.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions "consumer uncertainty" that could relate to economic pressures from inflation and income dynamics, it primarily reports a specific corporate sales metric without directly discussing the relationship between income growth, inflation, or how different economic groups are affected by price and wage changes. The focus on McDonald's sales data makes it more of a business performance story than an analysis of broader income-inflation dynamics.</div>
