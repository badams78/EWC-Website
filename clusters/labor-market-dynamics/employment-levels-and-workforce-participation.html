            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines employment participation rates, workforce composition, and labor force dynamics across demographic groups. Articles analyze statistical data on employment levels, non-participation rates among prime-age workers, gig economy participation, and demographic shifts affecting workforce availability. Common sources include government labor statistics, economic research, and industry reports focusing on quantitative workforce metrics. The content emphasizes participation patterns, automation impacts, and structural employment changes. Unlike its sibling focusing on wage growth and earnings trends, this subcluster concentrates on who works rather than compensation levels, examining workforce size, participation decisions, and employment accessibility across different population segments.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions ride-share drivers as a workforce category, it focuses primarily on specific income figures ($72,000-$75,000) rather than analyzing employment participation rates, workforce composition, or labor force dynamics across demographic groups.
