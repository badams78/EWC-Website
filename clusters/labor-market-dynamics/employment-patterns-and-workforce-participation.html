            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines workforce participation rates, employment patterns, and labor force composition across different demographics and work arrangements. Articles analyze participation rates by age groups, particularly prime-age workers and older Americans, while tracking the rise of gig economy and flexible work arrangements. Common data sources include Bureau of Labor Statistics employment reports, demographic surveys, and industry-specific workforce studies. The focus spans traditional employment metrics, non-standard work patterns like ride-sharing and contract labor, and structural changes including automation impacts. Unlike its sibling subcluster on wage growth and earnings trends, this cluster emphasizes who participates in the labor market and how work arrangements are evolving, rather than compensation levels.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions ride-share driving as a work arrangement, it focuses primarily on specific income figures ($72,000-$75,000) rather than analyzing workforce participation patterns, employment trends, or labor force composition across demographics.
