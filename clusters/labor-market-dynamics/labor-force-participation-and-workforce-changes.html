            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines shifts in workforce composition and participation patterns rather than compensation trends. Articles analyze labor force participation rates across demographic groups, particularly prime-age workers and older Americans, alongside emerging employment forms like gig work and flexible labor arrangements. Common data sources include Bureau of Labor Statistics employment statistics, demographic workforce surveys, and company-specific automation reports. Coverage spans traditional employment metrics, non-participation causes, and alternative work structures from ride-sharing to contract labor. Unlike its sibling focusing on wage growth and earnings trends, this subcluster emphasizes who participates in work and how, rather than what they earn, capturing structural workforce transformations and participation barriers.</p>
