            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the economic impacts of minimum wage policies and government income support programs on workers and households. Articles analyze data from sources like CBO, CPS, HUD, and randomized controlled trials to assess how wage mandates, public housing assistance, tax credits, and direct cash transfers affect employment levels, household income, and poverty rates. The research spans both theoretical policy analysis and empirical studies, including natural experiments and controlled interventions. Unlike sibling subclusters focused on broader wage trends or aggregate employment patterns, this collection specifically investigates targeted government interventions designed to support low-income workers and families, evaluating both intended benefits and unintended consequences like potential job losses from wage increases.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P2_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions government subsidies (income support), its primary focus is on tax policy for families with children rather than minimum wage policies or traditional income support programs like welfare or unemployment benefits. The content is more closely aligned with family tax policy and demographic considerations (subsidizing parents) than with the typical minimum wage and income support analysis that characterizes this cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P8_S2</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses a government income support program (Pandemic Unemployment Assistance), it focuses specifically on fraud and program integrity issues rather than analyzing the economic impacts on workers and households that characterize the cluster. The article's emphasis on audit findings and fraud detection aligns more closely with government spending oversight and program reform themes than with research examining how income support policies affect economic outcomes for recipients.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses income support effects (the earnings disincentive created by housing subsidies), its primary focus is on housing policy mechanics and long-term housing dependency rather than broader minimum wage and income support program analysis. The article's emphasis on HUD housing data and rental assistance duration makes it more naturally aligned with housing affordability discussions than with general income support policy evaluation.</div>
