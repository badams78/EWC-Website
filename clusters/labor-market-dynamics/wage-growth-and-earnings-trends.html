            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster analyzes wage and earnings patterns across American workers, focusing on real wage growth rates, income distribution trends, and sectoral variations in compensation. Articles frequently cite Federal Reserve data, Bank of America consumer insights, and academic research to examine how different worker segments - particularly bottom quartile earners, high school graduates, and college-educated workers - experience varying wage trajectories. Common themes include inflation's impact on real earnings, minimum wage effects, and the evolving college premium. The subcluster emphasizes quantitative analysis of compensation trends, often incorporating specific percentage changes and demographic breakdowns, while examining policy implications for Federal Reserve decisions and labor market interventions.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P8_S9</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions Thomas Piketty's work on inequality (which relates to wage and earnings distribution), it's actually a book review focused on critiquing the author's methodology rather than analyzing specific wage growth data or earnings trends. The content is more about economic theory and ideology critique than the empirical wage analysis that defines this cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P8_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article appears to be about natural design principles and flow dynamics rather than wage growth and earnings trends, making it a clear misclassification. The content about natural evolution and movement flows has no apparent connection to labor economics, compensation patterns, or income distribution analysis that defines the assigned cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S4</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses vocational training that can lead to higher wages in skilled trades, it focuses primarily on educational enrollment trends and demographic shifts rather than actual wage growth data or earnings patterns. The content is more about workforce pipeline development than the wage and compensation analysis that defines the cluster's core focus.</div>
