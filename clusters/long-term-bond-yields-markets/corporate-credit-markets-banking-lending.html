            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines corporate debt markets, bank lending practices, and credit conditions across sectors. Articles analyze corporate bond yields, credit spreads, and borrowing costs for investment-grade firms, often comparing these to Treasury benchmarks. Coverage includes commercial bank loan growth, mortgage rate dynamics, and alternative lending trends. Data sources feature bank internal metrics, credit default swap spreads, and debt service analytics from financial institutions and policy researchers. Unlike sibling clusters focused on Treasury market mechanics or fiscal sustainability metrics, this subcluster emphasizes private sector credit markets, corporate financing conditions, and banking sector lending behavior, including specialized areas like student loans and property insurance impacts on credit markets.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Corporate Credit Markets & Banking Lending" cluster because it discusses federal student debt cancellation rather than corporate borrowing or banking sector lending practices.

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P8_S6</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions student loans (a form of lending), it focuses primarily on the fiscal impact and budgetary cost of loan forgiveness rather than analyzing lending practices, credit markets, or borrowing conditions. The content is more aligned with budget analysis and fiscal policy evaluation than with corporate credit markets and banking operations.</div>
