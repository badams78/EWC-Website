            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines government fiscal health through analysis of budget deficits, debt-to-GDP ratios, and long-term sustainability metrics. Articles feature data from institutions like CBO, IMF, BIS, and Federal Reserve banks, offering econometric forecasts and policy recommendations. Content includes sovereign debt assessments, contingent liability analysis, and fiscal consolidation strategies across G7 nations. Unlike the sibling Treasury Market Dynamics subcluster which focuses on trading patterns and foreign investor flows, this group emphasizes fundamental fiscal mathematics and structural budget challenges that ultimately drive long-term borrowing costs and market confidence.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P9_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it focuses on equity market predictions and bearish market conditions rather than government fiscal metrics like budget deficits or debt-to-GDP ratios that define the assigned cluster. The content is more aligned with monetary policy and market risk assessment (hence the higher similarity to the Fed Rate Policy cluster) than with fiscal sustainability analysis.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P0_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions US government bonds (which relates to debt), it focuses on foreign ownership patterns rather than analyzing fiscal deficits, debt sustainability metrics, or government fiscal health. The content is more about international capital flows and foreign demand for US debt, which aligns better with the alternative cluster about dollar strength and trade balance dynamics.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions fiscal stimulus (which relates to government spending and deficits), it primarily focuses on the ideological shift in American liberalism toward monetary policy rather than providing concrete analysis of fiscal deficits, debt metrics, or sustainability data that characterizes this cluster. The article's emphasis on policy philosophy and monetary approaches makes it more aligned with broader economic policy discussions than the quantitative fiscal health analysis typical of this cluster.</div>
