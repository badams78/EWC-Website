            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines corporate borrowing costs, bank lending practices, and credit market dynamics within the broader long-term bond yield landscape. Articles analyze investment-grade corporate bond spreads, commercial bank loan growth, mortgage rate structures, and alternative lending channels. Common sources include Bank of America data, corporate bond trading platforms, and banking sector analytics. The content frequently compares corporate yields to Treasury benchmarks and explores post-crisis regulatory impacts on lending. Unlike sibling clusters focusing on government debt sustainability or Treasury market mechanics, this subcluster emphasizes private sector credit conditions, bank profitability considerations, and corporate financing costs as they relate to broader interest rate environments and economic policy implications.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions federal spending costs and budget estimates (which relates to fiscal analysis), it focuses specifically on student debt cancellation policy rather than corporate credit markets, bank lending practices, or bond yields that define the assigned cluster.

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions student loans (which are a form of lending), it primarily focuses on the fiscal cost and budgetary impact of a government forgiveness program rather than examining corporate credit markets, bank lending practices, or bond dynamics that define this cluster.

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Corporate Credit and Banking Sector Lending" cluster because it focuses on corporate capital allocation decisions (buybacks vs. reinvestment) rather than borrowing costs, lending practices, or credit market dynamics that define the cluster.
