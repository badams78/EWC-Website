            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines how creditworthiness and risk assessment affect borrowing costs across corporate, consumer, and sovereign debt markets. Articles analyze corporate bond spreads, investment-grade firm financing costs, mortgage rate dynamics, student loan impacts, and credit default swap pricing. Common sources include Bank of America data, financial analyst commentary, and market observations comparing yields across different credit instruments. Unlike sibling clusters focused on Treasury auction mechanics or fiscal deficit sustainability, this subcluster emphasizes market-determined risk premiums and the evolution of credit intermediation, particularly post-crisis regulatory changes affecting bank lending practices and the growth of alternative financing channels.</p>
