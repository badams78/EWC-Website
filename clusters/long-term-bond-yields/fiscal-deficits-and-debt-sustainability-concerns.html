            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the relationship between government fiscal imbalances and sovereign debt sustainability, focusing on how mounting deficits affect long-term borrowing costs. Articles analyze deficit projections, debt-to-GDP ratios, and policy recommendations from institutions like the CBO, IMF, BIS, and Federal Reserve banks. Coverage includes cross-country comparisons of fiscal positions, off-balance-sheet liabilities, and debt maturity strategies. Unlike the sibling subcluster on Treasury Market Demand which focuses on investor behavior and auction mechanics, this cluster emphasizes the fundamental fiscal drivers behind yield movements and sustainability thresholds that influence bond market dynamics.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P9_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Fiscal Deficits and Debt Sustainability Concerns" cluster because it focuses on equity market returns and bearish disequilibrium rather than government fiscal imbalances or sovereign debt issues. The content about expected stock market performance is more aligned with monetary policy and market dynamics (hence the higher similarity to "Fed Rate Cuts & Inflation Risk Debate") than with fiscal deficit analysis.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P0_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions US government bonds (which relates to debt sustainability), it primarily focuses on the changing composition of bond ownership by foreign investors rather than analyzing fiscal deficits or debt sustainability concerns directly. The decline in foreign ownership is more relevant to international capital flows and currency dynamics, which explains why it has higher similarity to the Trade Balances and Currency Dynamics cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P8_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions fiscal stimulus (relevant to fiscal policy), it primarily focuses on the ideological shift within American liberalism toward prioritizing monetary policy over fiscal measures, rather than analyzing actual fiscal deficits or debt sustainability concerns. The content is more about policy philosophy and the preference for monetary tools versus fiscal intervention, which aligns better with discussions of government market intervention approaches.</div>
