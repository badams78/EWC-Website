            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines Treasury market dynamics through the lens of foreign investment flows and international yield relationships. Articles analyze forward yield curves (10y10y, 10y20y), cross-border capital movements, and comparative sovereign debt markets, particularly Japan-US yield interactions and Bank of Japan intervention effects. Content draws heavily from market data, Federal Reserve bank holdings, and international debt-to-GDP ratios. The focus spans from technical yield curve analysis to broader questions of foreign demand for US Treasuries and global bond market interconnectedness. Unlike domestic-focused Treasury analysis, this subcluster emphasizes international perspectives and cross-market spillover effects on long-term US rates.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses Treasury market dynamics (10-year term premiums), it focuses on the domestic relationship between debt-to-GDP ratios and bond yields rather than the cluster's core theme of foreign demand and international investment flows. The research examines cognitive expectations and debt sustainability from a domestic policy perspective, which aligns more with debt management analysis than with cross-border Treasury market dynamics.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses Treasury market liquidity conditions (fitting the cluster's focus on market dynamics), it primarily analyzes yield-to-maturity pricing errors as a technical market performance indicator rather than examining foreign demand flows or international yield relationships that define this subcluster. The content aligns more closely with technical market analysis and performance metrics than with the international investment flows and cross-border dynamics that characterize the assigned cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P8_S2</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions Treasury holdings, it focuses specifically on domestic "real money managers" (like pension funds and insurance companies) rather than the foreign investment flows and international yield relationships that define this cluster.
