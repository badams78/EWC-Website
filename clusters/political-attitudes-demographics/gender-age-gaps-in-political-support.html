            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines demographic divides in political preferences, particularly focusing on generational and gender-based differences in electoral support and policy attitudes. Articles analyze polling data, survey research, and electoral outcomes to understand how age and gender shape political behavior across different countries and contexts. Common sources include major polling organizations like Pew, WSJ-NORC, and academic studies tracking demographic trends over time. The research reveals surprising patterns, such as young men's increasing conservative leanings and persistent gender gaps in religiosity and political trust. Unlike its sibling subcluster on voter demographics and electoral shifts, which focuses on broad population movements and voting patterns, this group specifically isolates age and gender as key variables driving political attitudes and party support across diverse political systems.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it reports on electoral results that could reveal demographic voting patterns (which would fit the "Gender & Age Gaps in Political Support" cluster), it focuses primarily on the immediate market reaction and surprise nature of Modi's electoral setback rather than analyzing the actual demographic breakdowns of voter support. The content is more about financial market impacts and general election outcomes than the specific generational or gender-based political preferences that define the assigned cluster.</div>
