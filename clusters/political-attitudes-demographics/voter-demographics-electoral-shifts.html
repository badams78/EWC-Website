            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster analyzes shifting voter demographics and electoral patterns through quantitative data and polling analysis. Articles examine demographic breakdowns by age, race, geography, and socioeconomic status, tracking how different voter groups' preferences evolve across election cycles. Common sources include voter registration data, exit polls, census information, and electoral analyses from outlets like New York Times and political observers. The focus spans local NYC politics to national presidential trends, documenting phenomena like residential political segregation, new voter registration patterns, and demographic coalition changes. Unlike broader political attitude research, this subcluster specifically emphasizes measurable electoral shifts and demographic voting patterns rather than ideological or policy preference analysis.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P7_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it focuses on international voting policy comparisons (voter ID requirements across OECD countries) rather than analyzing demographic voting patterns or electoral shifts within any specific electorate. While voter ID laws can affect different demographic groups differently, the article's emphasis is on cross-national policy differences rather than the demographic and electoral trend analysis that defines the cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P14_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions economic factors affecting industrial America (a key voter demographic), it focuses primarily on trade and manufacturing economics rather than analyzing actual voter behavior, electoral patterns, or demographic shifts. The content aligns much better with trade and economic policy discussions than with voter demographics and polling analysis.</div>
