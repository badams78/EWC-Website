            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines shifting voter demographics and electoral patterns through detailed analysis of voting data, registration trends, and geographic movements. Articles focus on age-based voting patterns, racial and ethnic voter preferences, new voter registration flows, and county-level electoral shifts across multiple election cycles. Common sources include polling data, voter file analysis, census demographics, and electoral returns. The content emphasizes quantitative analysis of how different demographic groups vote and how these patterns change over time and geography. Unlike broader political behavior research, this subcluster specifically tracks measurable demographic shifts and their electoral impacts rather than exploring underlying motivations or institutional factors.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P7_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it focuses on international voting policy comparisons and ID requirements rather than analyzing specific voter demographics, electoral shifts, or voting patterns within populations. While voter ID laws can indirectly affect turnout among different demographic groups, the article's emphasis is on policy differences between countries rather than examining how voter demographics are changing or shifting electoral outcomes.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P14_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions President Trump (a political figure), it focuses primarily on economic factors like trade-weighted dollar decline and manufacturing impacts rather than voter demographics, electoral patterns, or voting behavior analysis that defines the cluster. The content aligns much better with trade and economic topics, as evidenced by its higher similarity to the "China Trade Surplus & Export Growth" cluster.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions "Democrats" (a political party relevant to voter demographics), the content is primarily focused on accusations of political dishonesty regarding postal service policies rather than analyzing actual voting patterns, demographic shifts, or electoral data. The article appears to be more about political messaging and policy disputes than the data-driven examination of voter trends that characterizes this cluster.</div>
