            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines worldwide electricity demand patterns, capacity expansion, and capital allocation across power generation technologies. Articles feature quantitative data from industry analysts like IEA and Goldman Sachs, tracking metrics such as generation capacity additions, transmission infrastructure buildout, and investment flows between renewable versus fossil fuel sectors. Coverage spans regional comparisons of power production scales, corporate energy procurement strategies, and demand drivers including data centers and industrial electrification. Unlike the sibling subcluster focused on US energy export capabilities, this grouping emphasizes consumption-side dynamics and the global transition toward renewable generation capacity to meet accelerating electricity demand growth.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while Amazon's $148B data center investment will significantly increase global power demand (fitting the cluster's focus on electricity demand growth), the article specifically emphasizes Amazon's capital expenditure for data center infrastructure rather than broader power generation capacity or investment trends. The content is more aligned with AI/tech infrastructure spending than with comprehensive analysis of global electricity demand patterns and power sector investment allocation.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it contains quantitative data about infrastructure penetration that could relate to future power demand growth, it focuses primarily on current air conditioning adoption rates across specific countries rather than directly discussing electricity demand patterns, capacity expansion, or investment trends in power generation. The data is more descriptive of current household equipment penetration than analytical of power sector investment or demand growth dynamics.</div>
