            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster focuses on the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak and its escalating public health implications, tracking viral transmission across species barriers from birds to livestock and humans. Articles predominantly cite CDC data, WHO reports, and epidemiological studies, documenting infection rates in dairy herds, human cases, and emerging viral variants like D1.1. Coverage emphasizes surveillance data, serologic surveys, and genomic sequencing results. Unlike sibling subclusters examining energy infrastructure and scientific breakthroughs, this group addresses immediate biosecurity threats and disease containment challenges, representing a critical intersection of agricultural economics and pandemic preparedness within broader infrastructure resilience discussions.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the H5N1 Bird Flu cluster because while it involves an infectious disease outbreak with animal-to-human transmission (bat consumption), it describes an unidentified illness in the Democratic Republic of Congo rather than the H5N1 avian influenza strain that defines the cluster. The article shares the public health emergency theme but involves a different pathogen and transmission vector than the bird flu focus of the assigned cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it focuses primarily on the agricultural and economic impact of bird culls rather than the public health implications that define the cluster's core theme. While it mentions avian flu being endemic, it lacks discussion of human transmission, cross-species spread, or direct health risks to people, which are the key elements of the "H5N1 Bird Flu Outbreak & Public Health Impact" cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it directly reports on H5N1 bird flu findings in humans (which fits the cluster), it's a brief, technical data point from a CDC survey rather than a comprehensive discussion of the outbreak's broader public health implications and cross-species transmission patterns that typically characterize this cluster. The low similarity suggests it may be too narrow and clinical compared to other articles that more extensively cover the outbreak's escalating impact and transmission dynamics.</div>
