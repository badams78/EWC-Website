            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster focuses on the dramatic surge in investment and development within nuclear and fusion energy technologies, spanning both established nuclear power and cutting-edge fusion startups. Articles predominantly feature investment data, cost analyses, and technological breakthroughs from industry reports, startup announcements, and research institutions. Coverage includes private funding rounds, government policy initiatives, and comparative cost metrics between energy sources. Unlike sibling subclusters examining broad energy production trends or scientific discoveries, this cluster specifically tracks the financial and technological momentum behind nuclear renaissance efforts, emphasizing venture capital flows, regulatory changes, and commercial timelines for next-generation power technologies.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P3_S7</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Nuclear & Fusion Technology Investment Surge" cluster because it focuses on geothermal energy storage rather than nuclear or fusion technologies, despite sharing the common theme of clean energy solutions for carbon-free grids. While geothermal power relates to clean energy infrastructure like nuclear and fusion, it represents a fundamentally different technology category that doesn't involve the nuclear processes or investment patterns that define this cluster.</div>

        <li>
            <div class="title">2. The first new US nuclear facility in 30 years will start to deliver power this summer; however, cost overruns have led to diminished investor interest in future projects.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P3_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions a new nuclear facility, it emphasizes the negative financial impact of cost overruns and reduced investor confidence, which contradicts the "investment surge" theme of the cluster. The focus on diminished investor interest aligns more closely with broader power sector investment challenges than with the specific narrative of surging nuclear and fusion technology investments.</div>

            <div class="title">3. Fervo Energy is building a commercial geothermal facility that will power 300,000 Utah homes; the firm has started permitting on another half dozen facilities.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P3_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses clean energy investment and commercial facility development, it focuses specifically on geothermal technology rather than nuclear or fusion technologies. The content aligns better with broader power generation investment trends than with the nuclear/fusion-specific focus of this cluster.</div>
