            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster focuses on empirical climate data documenting unprecedented oceanic and cryospheric changes. Articles primarily present quantitative measurements from scientific institutions like NOAA and Nature publications, tracking ocean temperature records, marine heatwaves, glacial ice loss rates, and snowpack decline. The content emphasizes statistical benchmarks—record-breaking temperatures, percentage changes in ice coverage, and multi-decade trend analysis. Unlike sibling subclusters examining energy production economics or health policy impacts, these articles function as climate monitoring reports, providing foundational environmental data that underlies broader infrastructure and policy discussions within the parent cluster.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it presents quantitative empirical climate data showing unprecedented cryospheric changes (consistent with the cluster's focus), it specifically discusses Alpine snowpack rather than oceanic temperature records, making it more relevant to terrestrial water resources and supply challenges than ocean-focused climate measurements.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P3_S7</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses climate impacts and extreme temperature records (which aligns with the cluster's focus on empirical climate data), it primarily focuses on terrestrial Arctic temperatures and wildfire effects rather than oceanic temperature measurements or cryospheric changes that define the cluster's core theme. The article's emphasis on land-based phenomena like wildfire acreage makes it a poor fit for a cluster centered on ocean and ice-related climate data.</div>
