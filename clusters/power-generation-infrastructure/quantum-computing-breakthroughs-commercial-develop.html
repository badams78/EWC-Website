            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions Microsoft and quantum computing development (fitting the commercial aspect), it primarily emphasizes a "technical breakthrough" documented by researchers and published in Nature, which aligns more with scientific research and discovery rather than commercial development or industry competition. The focus on the research breakthrough itself, rather than Microsoft's commercial quantum computing strategy or market positioning, makes it more suitable for the Scientific Research & Discovery cluster.</div>
