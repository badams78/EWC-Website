            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster encompasses fundamental scientific breakthroughs across diverse research domains, from CRISPR gene editing and AI-driven protein design to cosmic ray physics and asteroid discoveries. Articles typically report on peer-reviewed research from leading institutions like MIT and Google DeepMind, featuring empirical findings, experimental results, and technological innovations. Unlike its sibling subclusters focusing on energy production metrics and infrastructure investment trends, this collection emphasizes basic science discoveries that may eventually influence energy technologies. Content spans biological systems research, space science, artificial intelligence applications in molecular biology, and particle physics, representing the foundational research pipeline that precedes commercial energy applications.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions asteroid discovery (fitting the "asteroid discoveries" aspect of the cluster), it focuses primarily on planetary defense and collision risk assessment rather than fundamental scientific breakthroughs or research discoveries. The content is more about space threat monitoring and mitigation efforts, which aligns better with the practical/commercial space activities in the alternative cluster than with the research-focused nature of the assigned cluster.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it focuses entirely on macroeconomic indicators like inflation, labor markets, and business investment rather than scientific research or discovery breakthroughs.

The treatment's specific focus on lifespan extension through cytokine inhibition lacks the interdisciplinary breadth seen in other cluster examples like CRISPR, AI protein design, and cosmic discoveries.</div>
