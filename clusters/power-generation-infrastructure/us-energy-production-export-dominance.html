            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines America's emergence as a dominant global energy exporter, focusing on record-breaking domestic production levels, massive infrastructure investments, and shifting geopolitical energy dynamics. Articles typically feature quantitative data on production volumes, export revenues, pipeline construction, and price movements, often sourced from energy analysts, federal statistics, and market reports. The content emphasizes the US transformation from energy importer to net exporter, highlighting strategic advantages over traditional producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia. Coverage includes both fossil fuel dominance and decarbonization opportunities that could further expand export capacity to emerging markets.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P3_S6</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "US Energy Production & Export Dominance" cluster because it focuses on Germany's LNG import infrastructure rather than US energy production or export activities. While it's tangentially related to global energy trade that the US participates in, the article doesn't actually discuss American energy dominance, production levels, or export infrastructure - making it a poor fit for this cluster's core theme.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P0_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions petrodollar recycling (which connects to oil/energy markets), it primarily focuses on financial flows and sovereign wealth fund investment strategies rather than US energy production capacity, export volumes, or domestic energy infrastructure. The content is more aligned with currency and financial dynamics than with America's energy production dominance.</div>

            <div class="title">3. Germany has opened the first of five floating storage and regasification units, each with a capacity of 5B cubic meters per year of gas. Overall, Germany will soon have LNG import capacity of half the total volume of Russian gas imported last year. @FT</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P8_S7</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article focuses entirely on Germany's new LNG import infrastructure to replace Russian gas, with no mention of US energy production or exports, making it geographically and thematically misaligned with a cluster about American energy dominance. The content is much more relevant to European energy security and Germany's economic/industrial situation, which explains why it has higher similarity to the German Economic Decline cluster.</div>
