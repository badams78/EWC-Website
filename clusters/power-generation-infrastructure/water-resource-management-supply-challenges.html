            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines water scarcity, distribution challenges, and infrastructure responses across major economies. Articles analyze regional water depletion patterns, groundwater reserve decline, and climate-induced supply stress, particularly in the US Southwest and China. Content draws from federal analyses, economic impact assessments, and policy announcements regarding water allocation agreements and pricing mechanisms. Unlike sibling subclusters focused on energy production or technological breakthroughs, this cluster emphasizes resource constraints and adaptive management strategies, including massive infrastructure investments like China's Yarlung Tsangpo dam project that bridges water security with power generation objectives.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P3_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it involves water infrastructure (a massive dam project), the primary focus is on electricity generation capacity and economic impact rather than water scarcity, distribution challenges, or supply management issues that define the assigned cluster. The content aligns more closely with power generation and energy infrastructure investment, which explains its higher similarity to the Global Power Demand Growth & Investment Trends cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions water pricing in Arizona, it focuses primarily on the economic/pricing aspect rather than the technical water resource management, infrastructure, or scarcity analysis that characterizes the cluster. The emphasis on price increases and market dynamics makes it more similar to affordability and pricing trend discussions than to water supply infrastructure or distribution challenges.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions rainfall patterns that relate to water supply, it focuses primarily on documenting climate extremes (droughts and increased rainfall frequency) rather than examining the specific water management challenges, infrastructure responses, or distribution issues that define the assigned cluster.
