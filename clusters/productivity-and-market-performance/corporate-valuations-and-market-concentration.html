            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines corporate financial performance through market valuation metrics and industry concentration dynamics. Articles analyze equity market trends using measures like CAPE ratios, total returns, and price-earnings multiples, often drawing from major indices like the S&P 500. The content frequently cites academic research on markup trends and market power, alongside financial analyst forecasts from institutions like Goldman Sachs. Coverage spans venture capital performance data, AI investment impacts on firm valuations, and structural changes in corporate financing patterns. Articles typically blend quantitative market data with economic research findings, examining how technological disruption and market concentration affect corporate valuations and investor returns over multi-decade periods.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Corporate Valuations and Market Concentration" cluster because while it involves a major corporate bankruptcy that could affect market valuations, it focuses primarily on a specific debt restructuring event rather than analyzing broader market valuation metrics, CAPE ratios, or industry concentration dynamics that define the cluster's core theme. The content is more about corporate distress and international financial obligations than systematic valuation analysis or market concentration trends.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article focuses on federal government spending and fiscal policy rather than corporate valuations or market concentration metrics, making it a poor fit for a cluster that examines equity market trends and industry dynamics.

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions corporate defaults (a valuation-impacting event), it focuses primarily on credit market distress and bond defaults in China's real estate sector rather than examining market valuation metrics, equity performance, or industry concentration dynamics that define the assigned cluster. The content about developer defaults and dollar bond markets aligns much better with the "Corporate Credit Markets & Banking Lending" cluster, which directly addresses credit distress and lending issues.</div>
