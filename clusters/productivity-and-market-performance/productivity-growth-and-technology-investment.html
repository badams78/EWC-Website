            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the relationship between technological advancement and economic productivity growth, with particular focus on sectoral variations and measurement challenges. Articles analyze productivity trends across manufacturing, IT, and service industries using empirical data from government statistics, industry reports, and longitudinal studies. Common themes include the productivity paradox, digital transformation impacts, and cross-industry performance comparisons spanning decades. Unlike the sibling Corporate Valuations cluster which focuses on market-based financial metrics, this subcluster emphasizes real economic output measures and operational efficiency gains from technology adoption and innovation investments.</p>
