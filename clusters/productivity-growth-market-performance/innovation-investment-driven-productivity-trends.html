            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the drivers and patterns of productivity growth through the lens of innovation and investment trends. Articles analyze sectoral productivity variations, particularly contrasting manufacturing gains with service sector stagnation, and investigate the role of IT investments, R&D spending, and technological adoption in economic performance. Content draws from productivity statistics, industry-specific output measures, and historical merger analysis to understand long-term growth trajectories. Unlike its sibling focusing on market concentration effects, this cluster emphasizes the input-side factors and investment decisions that fuel productivity changes, including infrastructure spending, digital transformation, and manufacturing innovation across different time periods and economic sectors.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions technology usage (TikTok/social media) which could relate to digital innovation trends, it primarily focuses on youth behavioral patterns and time allocation rather than analyzing productivity drivers, investment trends, or innovation impacts on economic output.
