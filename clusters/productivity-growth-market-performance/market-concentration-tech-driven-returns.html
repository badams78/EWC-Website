            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the intersection of market concentration trends and technology-driven investment returns in modern economies. Articles analyze corporate markup increases, equity valuations using metrics like CAPE ratios, and AI's impact on firm performance and productivity. Common data sources include academic studies on market power, financial analytics from major institutions like Goldman Sachs, and corporate performance metrics spanning decades. The focus integrates empirical research on industrial concentration with investment analysis, particularly examining how technological transformation affects market structure and returns. Coverage spans venture capital performance, corporate financing patterns, and valuation adjustments for intangible assets in tech-heavy markets.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P0_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article about Evergrande's bankruptcy filing is borderline because it focuses on a specific corporate debt crisis and legal proceedings rather than broader market concentration trends or technology-driven returns that define the cluster. The content deals with financial distress and bankruptcy protection, which has minimal relevance to analyzing how market concentration and technological innovation impact investment performance and corporate markups.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Market Concentration & Tech-Driven Returns" cluster because it focuses on federal government spending categories and fiscal policy rather than corporate market dynamics, technology investments, or equity valuations. While government spending can indirectly influence market conditions, the article's emphasis on Medicaid, Social Security, and federal budget analysis doesn't directly address the cluster's core themes of corporate concentration trends or technology-driven investment returns.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P1_S2</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions corporate defaults and bond markets (which relates to credit markets), it primarily focuses on China's real estate crisis and developer defaults rather than discussing market concentration trends, technology-driven returns, or corporate markup analysis that defines the assigned cluster. The content about defaulted dollar bonds and financial crisis is much better aligned with the "Credit Markets and Corporate Borrowing Costs" cluster, as evidenced by the higher similarity score of 0.52.</div>
