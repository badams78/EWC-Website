            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the drivers and obstacles to productivity growth across sectors, with particular emphasis on technology adoption, innovation patterns, and structural economic changes. Articles typically analyze productivity metrics, total factor productivity (TFP) data, and sectoral performance comparisons, drawing from manufacturing output measures, IT investment statistics, and historical productivity trends. The research spans from quantitative assessments of productivity slowdowns since 2004 to broader examinations of technological disruption, merger waves, and digital transformation impacts. Unlike sibling subclusters focused on market concentration and corporate valuations, this collection prioritizes understanding productivity dynamics through innovation cycles, technology diffusion, and the complex relationship between digital adoption and measurable economic output across industries.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions technology adoption (TikTok usage) which could relate to productivity impacts, it primarily focuses on social media consumption patterns among young Americans rather than examining actual productivity growth drivers, innovation dynamics, or structural economic changes.

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions major tech platforms (YouTube, TikTok) that could relate to technology adoption and digital innovation dynamics, the focus is purely on teenage usage patterns rather than productivity impacts, innovation drivers, or economic growth effects. The data about youth social media consumption habits is more naturally aligned with behavioral and social trends than with productivity and innovation analysis.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions technology adoption (social media's "pivot to video"), its primary focus is on media consumption patterns and their political implications rather than productivity growth or innovation dynamics in the economic sense. The content is more closely aligned with political preference analysis, as evidenced by its higher similarity to the "Gender & Age Political Preference Gaps" cluster, since it discusses how different media formats favor different political ideologies.</div>
