            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the evolution and economic drivers of drug epidemics, particularly the opioid crisis and overdose mortality patterns across US regions. Articles analyze CDC mortality data, SSDI disability trends, and international drug market dynamics to understand how economic factors like prescription pricing, black market competition, and regional economic decline influence addiction rates. Coverage spans from fentanyl's displacement of traditional opioids to recent declines in overdose deaths. Unlike sibling clusters focused on housing costs or urban crime, this subcluster specifically tracks drug-related mortality as both a public health crisis and economic phenomenon shaped by pharmaceutical markets and regional socioeconomic conditions.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P2_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses the drug trade's economic dynamics (poppy prices falling due to fentanyl competition), it focuses on international supply-side economics in Guatemala rather than the core cluster themes of US overdose mortality trends and domestic epidemic patterns. The article addresses the upstream economic drivers of the opioid crisis but lacks the epidemiological and public health data analysis that characterizes the cluster's primary focus.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses cocaine (a drug that contributes to overdose deaths), it focuses primarily on international production and market dynamics rather than overdose mortality trends or epidemic patterns within the US, which is the cluster's main emphasis. The content is more about global drug trade economics than the public health and mortality data analysis that defines this cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the drug epidemic cluster because while it examines mortality trends among prime-age adults (a key demographic in overdose studies), it actually challenges the "deaths of despair" narrative by arguing that mental health is not the predominant driver of these deaths, which contradicts the typical framing of the opioid crisis as being fundamentally linked to despair and psychological factors. The article's focus on disputing mental health as the primary explanation for mortality trends makes it more aligned with youth mental health research methodology than with typical drug epidemic analyses that assume psychological drivers.</div>
