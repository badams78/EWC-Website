            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the evolving landscape of drug overdose mortality and addiction trends in the United States, with particular focus on the opioid and fentanyl epidemics. Articles analyze CDC mortality data, regional variation in overdose patterns, and economic drivers including drug pricing dynamics and market shifts. Coverage spans from supply-side factors like poppy cultivation economics to demand-side elements such as disability insurance correlations. Unlike sibling subclusters addressing housing costs or population mobility, this focuses specifically on public health crises affecting urban communities, tracking both the devastating peak of overdose deaths and recent encouraging declines, while exploring underlying socioeconomic determinants.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P2_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses fentanyl's impact on drug markets, it focuses primarily on agricultural economics and pricing trends in Guatemala rather than directly examining overdose mortality or addiction trends in the United States. The geographic focus on Guatemala and emphasis on poppy farming economics makes it more tangentially related to the core themes of U.S. drug overdose epidemiology that define this cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses cocaine production and trafficking trends, it focuses on global supply dynamics and market shifts rather than actual overdose mortality data or health outcomes that define the core cluster theme. The piece is more about international drug trade economics than the public health crisis and mortality trends that characterize most articles in this cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the drug overdose cluster because while it examines mortality trends among prime-age adults (which could include overdose deaths), it specifically challenges the "deaths of despair" narrative by arguing against mental health as the primary driver, suggesting the focus may be broader than just drug overdoses. The article appears to be more about general mortality analysis and debunking established theories rather than specifically examining drug overdose patterns or epidemic trends.</div>
