            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines drug overdose mortality patterns and opioid crisis dynamics through quantitative analysis of health data trends. Articles predominantly analyze CDC mortality statistics, regional epidemiological patterns, and economic factors driving substance abuse, including prescription pricing and black market drug supply chains. Coverage spans demographic-specific mortality rates, geographic clustering of overdose deaths, and emerging trends in fentanyl versus traditional opioids. Unlike sibling subclusters focused on housing markets or general demographic shifts, this collection specifically targets public health crises as urban policy challenges, emphasizing data-driven approaches to understanding addiction's socioeconomic determinants and regional variations.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses the opioid supply chain (poppy cultivation for heroin production), it focuses on agricultural economics and market dynamics in Guatemala rather than health data trends, mortality statistics, or overdose patterns that define the assigned cluster. The content is more about international drug trade economics than the public health and epidemiological analysis that characterizes the subcluster's focus on overdose mortality and crisis dynamics.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Drug Overdose & Opioid Crisis Trends" cluster because it focuses on cocaine production and market dynamics rather than the overdose mortality statistics and opioid-specific health data trends that define the cluster's core focus. While cocaine is a relevant substance in the broader drug crisis, the article's emphasis on production statistics and international market shifts doesn't align with the cluster's analytical approach to health outcomes and opioid crisis patterns.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it analyzes mortality trends among a specific demographic group (prime-age non-Hispanic Whites), it focuses on challenging the "deaths of despair" mental health narrative rather than examining drug overdose patterns or opioid crisis dynamics specifically.
