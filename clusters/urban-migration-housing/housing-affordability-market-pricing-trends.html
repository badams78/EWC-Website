            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines housing market dynamics through quantitative analysis of home prices, affordability metrics, and demographic trends in homeownership. Articles predominantly feature Federal Reserve data, real estate market statistics, and academic research tracking price movements, buyer age demographics, and affordability ratios over time. The focus centers on measurable housing market indicators including median home prices, first-time buyer statistics, regional price variations, and historical comparisons of housing costs relative to income. Content typically presents empirical data from central banks, real estate organizations, and economic research institutions, emphasizing statistical trends rather than policy prescriptions or qualitative housing experiences.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it involves housing policy (social housing demolition), it focuses on immigration integration and social policy rather than market pricing, affordability metrics, or homeownership trends that define the cluster. The content is more aligned with social policy and demographic integration issues than with the quantitative housing market analysis that characterizes this cluster.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions housing affordability as a political issue, it primarily focuses on comparative voting patterns and political preferences among young demographics across different countries, rather than analyzing actual housing market data, pricing trends, or affordability metrics.

            <div class="edge-reason">This article discusses China's economic transition and educational demographics but contains no content about housing prices, affordability metrics, or homeownership trends that would align with the assigned cluster. The article is borderline because it focuses on China's broader economic development phase and educational statistics rather than housing market dynamics, making it a better fit for the China Trade & Export Growth cluster which deals with China's economic patterns.</div>
