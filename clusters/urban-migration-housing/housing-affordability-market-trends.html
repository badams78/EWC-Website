            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines housing market dynamics and affordability challenges facing American homebuyers. Articles analyze Federal Reserve data, real estate research, and demographic trends showing rising median ages of first-time buyers, record home prices relative to historical levels, and wealth barriers to homeownership. Common sources include FRBNY data, academic research, and market analyses from Goldman Sachs and similar institutions. Coverage spans price appreciation patterns, mortgage rate impacts, supply-demand imbalances, and generational shifts in housing access. The focus remains primarily quantitative, tracking market metrics and affordability indices rather than policy interventions or urban planning approaches that might characterize other housing-focused subclusters.</p>

            <div class="title">1. Denmark is seeking to better integrate non-Danes into Danish society by demolishing social housing in neighborhoods with low income, low education, high unemployment, and high criminal convictions where at least half of the population is non-Western.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P8_S9</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Housing Affordability & Market Trends" cluster because while it involves housing policy (demolishing social housing), it focuses on Denmark's immigration integration strategy rather than housing market dynamics or affordability challenges facing homebuyers. The article's emphasis on demographics, social integration, and government policy toward non-Western populations aligns much better with Nordic policy analysis than with housing market trends.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P7_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions housing affordability as a political issue, it's primarily focused on comparing youth voting patterns between the US and Canada rather than analyzing actual housing market dynamics, affordability data, or homebuyer trends. The article fits better with political demographics analysis since it's fundamentally about how housing policy positions influence young voters' political preferences rather than examining the housing market itself.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Housing Affordability & Market Trends" cluster because it focuses on China's economic transition and educational demographics rather than housing market dynamics or affordability issues. The content about China's industrial development phase and undergraduate major ratios has no clear connection to real estate markets, making it a poor fit that should likely be reassigned to the "China Trade Surplus & Export Growth" cluster.</div>
