            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines housing market dynamics through the lens of affordability challenges and price movements. Articles predominantly analyze statistical trends using data from Federal Reserve banks, real estate research firms like Goldman Sachs, and demographic studies tracking homebuyer age and wealth thresholds. The content focuses on quantitative indicators including median home prices, first-time buyer statistics, net worth requirements, and regional price comparisons over time. Coverage spans from macro-level housing market analysis to specific demographic impacts, with particular attention to generational affordability gaps. While most articles concentrate on US housing data and trends, some pieces incorporate international perspectives on housing policy interventions and social integration through housing development strategies.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P8_S9</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it involves housing policy (social housing demolition), it focuses primarily on immigration integration and social policy rather than housing affordability metrics, price trends, or market dynamics that characterize the assigned cluster. The content aligns better with analysis of Scandinavian social and economic models, as it examines Denmark's approach to addressing social integration challenges through housing policy interventions.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions housing affordability as a political issue, it primarily focuses on comparing voting patterns and political preferences between young voters in the US and Canada rather than analyzing actual housing market data, price trends, or affordability metrics. The article treats housing affordability as a campaign issue driving political behavior rather than examining the housing market dynamics and statistical trends that define the assigned cluster.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Housing Affordability & Price Trends" cluster because it focuses on China's broader economic transition and educational demographics rather than housing market data or affordability issues. The content about China's industrial development phase and undergraduate major ratios has no clear connection to housing prices or market dynamics, making it much better suited for the alternative "China Trade Surplus & Export Growth" cluster which deals with China's economic trends.</div>
