            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the growing crisis in property insurance markets driven by escalating climate-related disasters and their cascading effects on housing markets. Articles analyze insurer financial losses, regulatory responses, and risk assessment methodologies, drawing heavily on state regulatory data, reinsurance reports, and catastrophe bond performance metrics. Coverage spans premium increases, insurer insolvencies, policy cancellations, and innovative policy solutions like Florida's property tax reforms. Unlike sibling clusters focusing on broader housing affordability trends or demographic shifts, this subcluster specifically addresses how disaster risk is reshaping insurance markets and creating location-specific housing vulnerabilities that threaten traditional homeownership models.</p>

            <div class="title">1. While Florida home prices continue to decline as prices in most other states rise, @AzizSunderji argues “Florida's downturn is unlikely to be a harbinger of things to come” nationally, due to factors idiosyncratic to the state.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it focuses on Florida's declining home prices (which fits the "Housing Affordability & Price Trends" cluster), Florida's housing market challenges are heavily influenced by the state's property insurance crisis driven by hurricane risks and climate disasters, making it relevant to both clusters. The article appears to be more about general housing price trends rather than specifically analyzing the insurance crisis impacts that define the assigned cluster.</div>

            <div class="title">2. The ongoing Los Angeles wildfires will cost somewhere between $52-57B, according to a preliminary estimate by AccuWeather.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions wildfire costs that could impact insurance markets, it focuses primarily on the economic damage estimate ($52-57B) rather than discussing insurance market dynamics, insurer financial stress, or the broader crisis in property insurance availability that defines the assigned cluster. The article's emphasis on quantifying disaster costs aligns more closely with general economic impact reporting than with the specific insurance crisis narrative.</div>

            <div class="title">3. While 12% of the $50B catastrophe bond market is exposed to wildfire risk, analysts project that losses on Los Angeles wildfires will be taken largely by primary insurers and junior reinsurance layers, with minimal impact on cat bonds.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P1_S2</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses wildfire risk and insurance market impacts (fitting the disaster risk theme), it focuses primarily on the technical performance and risk distribution of catastrophe bonds as financial instruments rather than the broader insurance crisis affecting property markets and housing accessibility. The emphasis on specific bond market mechanics and institutional investor impacts makes it lean more toward financial market analysis than the cluster's focus on insurance availability and affordability challenges for consumers.</div>
