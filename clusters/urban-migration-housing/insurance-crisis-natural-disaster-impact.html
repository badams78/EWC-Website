            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the intersection of natural disasters and insurance market disruptions affecting housing markets, particularly through regulatory analysis and financial data. Articles predominantly feature insurance industry statistics, regulatory filings, catastrophe bond performance metrics, and state-level policy responses to climate-related risks. Coverage emphasizes quantitative analysis from industry sources like Swiss Re, Demotech ratings, and state insurance commissioners. Unlike sibling subclusters focused on broader affordability trends or demographic migration patterns, this collection specifically targets how climate risk and insurance availability create localized housing market distortions, with Florida serving as a primary case study for insurance-driven real estate volatility.</p>

            <div class="title">1. While Florida home prices continue to decline as prices in most other states rise, @AzizSunderji argues “Florida's downturn is unlikely to be a harbinger of things to come” nationally, due to factors idiosyncratic to the state.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses Florida's housing market decline, it doesn't explicitly mention insurance crises or natural disasters as the driving factors, instead only alluding to "idiosyncratic" state-specific issues. The content focuses more on general housing market trends and price movements, which aligns better with the "Housing Affordability & Market Trends" cluster that examines broader real estate market dynamics.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions wildfire costs that would typically impact insurance markets and housing (core themes of the assigned cluster), it only provides a basic cost estimate without discussing insurance market disruptions, regulatory implications, or housing market effects that define the cluster's focus. The article's simple financial reporting style makes it more similar to general market trend coverage found in the "Housing Affordability & Market Trends" cluster rather than the specialized insurance-disaster analysis expected in its assigned cluster.</div>

            <div class="title">3. While 12% of the $50B catastrophe bond market is exposed to wildfire risk, analysts project that losses on Los Angeles wildfires will be taken largely by primary insurers and junior reinsurance layers, with minimal impact on cat bonds.</div>
