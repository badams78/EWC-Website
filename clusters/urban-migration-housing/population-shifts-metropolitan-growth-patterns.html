            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines demographic shifts and economic forces driving metropolitan population changes across the US. Articles analyze domestic migration patterns, particularly outflows from high-cost cities like NYC and California, using census data and labor statistics to track where Americans are relocating. Common themes include declining mobility rates, job growth concentration in specific metros, and the relationship between industry clusters and workforce migration. Sources typically include government demographic data, economic analyses, and policy research. Unlike its sibling focusing on housing costs and affordability metrics, this subcluster emphasizes broader population movements, economic drivers of relocation decisions, and regional growth patterns that reshape metropolitan landscapes over time.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions NYC (a major metropolitan area), it focuses specifically on education policy and school improvement rather than population movements or demographic shifts. The content is much more aligned with K-12 education policy, as evidenced by the higher similarity score (0.57) with the Early Childhood & K-12 Education cluster, since it deals with school performance and municipal education program decisions rather than migration patterns or metropolitan growth dynamics.</div>
