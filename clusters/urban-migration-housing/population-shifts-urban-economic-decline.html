            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines demographic and economic shifts driving urban population changes, focusing on out-migration patterns from major metropolitan areas like NYC and California. Articles analyze census data, migration statistics, and employment trends to understand how domestic relocation affects urban economies. Coverage includes the fiscal implications of population loss, sectoral job shifts, and declining mobility rates over decades. Unlike its sibling subcluster on housing affordability which emphasizes market pricing dynamics, this group concentrates on broader demographic flows and their economic consequences for cities experiencing decline or growth transitions.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S10</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions NYC (fitting the urban focus), it's primarily about education policy and school performance rather than population shifts or economic decline. The content aligns much better with the education policy cluster, as it discusses a specific educational program's termination due to poor results rather than analyzing demographic migration patterns or urban economic trends.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P12_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while Palm Beach's dramatic home price increases could indicate wealthy migration patterns (relevant to urban population shifts), the article focuses primarily on real estate valuation rather than analyzing actual demographic movements or urban economic decline. The content is more aligned with wealth concentration and high-end real estate markets than the cluster's core focus on out-migration patterns and urban economic deterioration.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions New York's budget deficits, it focuses specifically on federal spending cuts and fiscal shortfalls rather than examining the demographic shifts, population migration patterns, or urban economic decline that characterize the assigned cluster. The content aligns more closely with budget and legislative analysis than with population movement and urban demographic trends.</div>
