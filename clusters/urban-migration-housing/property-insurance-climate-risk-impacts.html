            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the intersection of property insurance markets and climate-driven risks, focusing on how natural disasters and extreme weather events are reshaping housing costs and availability. Articles analyze insurer financial performance, regulatory responses, and market disruptions across states, with particular attention to high-risk regions like Florida. Common sources include industry data from reinsurers, state regulatory filings, and financial analyses of insurance company losses and premium adjustments. Unlike sibling subclusters that focus on broader housing affordability trends or demographic migration patterns, this subcluster specifically targets the insurance sector's role as a critical intermediary between climate risk and housing market stability, documenting how rising catastrophe exposure forces insurers to withdraw from markets or dramatically increase premiums.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses Florida's declining home prices, it doesn't explicitly mention property insurance or climate risks as driving factors, despite Florida being heavily impacted by hurricanes and insurance challenges. The content focuses more on general housing price trends and market dynamics, which aligns better with the "Housing Affordability & Price Trends" cluster, even though Florida's "idiosyncratic factors" likely include climate-related insurance issues.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions wildfire damage costs (a climate risk), it focuses primarily on the economic valuation of property losses rather than examining how these events specifically impact insurance markets, coverage availability, or policy changes. The content is more about quantifying disaster costs than analyzing the insurance industry's response to climate risks or how such events affect property insurability and market dynamics.</div>
