            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines urban crime patterns, policing strategies, and public safety deterioration in American cities. Articles analyze violent crime surges, particularly the 61% increase between 2019-2024, alongside rising youth criminality and public disorder issues like fare evasion and homelessness. Data sources include FBI crime statistics, victimization surveys, and prison population reports. Coverage spans traditional metrics like murder rates and property crime to broader quality-of-life concerns including graffiti and public space misuse. Unlike sibling clusters focused on housing economics or population demographics, this subcluster specifically addresses criminal justice outcomes and urban safety governance challenges.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Urban Crime & Public Safety Trends" cluster because while it discusses public safety and policing strategies, it focuses on "public disorder" and quality-of-life issues (homelessness, litter, graffiti) rather than the violent crime statistics and crime surges that appear to be the cluster's primary focus. The article's emphasis on non-violent public space issues may not align well with a subcluster that specifically examines violent crime patterns and surges.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Urban Crime & Public Safety Trends" cluster because while it addresses public safety concerns, it focuses on mass violence prevention through data analysis and policy changes rather than the cluster's core themes of urban crime patterns, policing strategies, and city-specific crime statistics. The article's emphasis on federal privacy laws, red-flag legislation, and mental health treatment represents a broader policy approach to violence prevention that doesn't align well with the cluster's focus on urban crime trends and traditional policing responses.</div>

The research emphasis on how parental incarceration affects children's future trajectories aligns more closely with education and child development policy research than with studies of urban crime trends and public safety measures.</div>
