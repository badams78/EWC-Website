            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines population movements between US cities and their economic drivers, focusing on domestic migration patterns, workforce mobility, and regional economic shifts. Articles analyze census data, employment statistics, and demographic trends to understand why people relocate, particularly the exodus from expensive cities like NYC and California's tech sector decline. The content emphasizes macro-level migration flows, policy impacts on population movement, and economic consequences of demographic shifts. Unlike its sibling focusing on housing affordability and market dynamics, this subcluster prioritizes population mobility patterns and their broader economic implications rather than real estate pricing mechanisms.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P10_S10</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions an NYC program (suggesting urban context), it primarily focuses on educational policy failure rather than population movements or economic migration patterns that define the cluster. The content is much more aligned with educational interventions and policy effectiveness, as evidenced by the higher similarity score (0.57) to that alternative cluster.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Urban Population Shifts & Economic Migration" cluster because while dramatic home price increases can drive population movements and reflect economic migration patterns, the article only reports price data without discussing actual population shifts, migration flows, or their underlying economic drivers. The focus is purely on real estate valuation rather than the demographic and migration dynamics that define the cluster's core theme.</div>
