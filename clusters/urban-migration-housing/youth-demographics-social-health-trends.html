            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines behavioral patterns, mental health trends, and social outcomes among young people, primarily focusing on American youth aged 12-25. Articles frequently cite government surveys like BLS's American Time Use Survey and CDC data to track changes in social engagement, mental health indicators, and lifestyle behaviors over time. The research emphasizes longitudinal analysis, comparing current youth behaviors to historical patterns, particularly noting declines in social activities like party attendance and shifts in conscientiousness. Unlike sibling subclusters focused on housing economics or demographic migration, this collection prioritizes psychological and social wellness metrics, drawing from academic studies and policy research to understand how contemporary youth experience differs from previous generations in terms of social connection and mental health outcomes.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P3_S4</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article about reflective white paint technology is clearly misplaced in the "Youth Demographics & Social Health Trends" cluster, as it focuses on materials science and cooling technology rather than behavioral patterns or mental health among young people. The article belongs in the "Climate Change & Ocean Temperature Records" cluster since it discusses a potential climate mitigation technology that could help reduce urban heat and energy consumption.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P3_S2</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because it focuses on a specific genetic mutation and Alzheimer's research rather than behavioral patterns or mental health trends among youth aged 12-25. The content is clearly about scientific/medical research findings published in Nature, making it a much better fit for the "Scientific Research & Technology Breakthroughs" cluster than one examining youth demographics and social health trends.</div>

While COVID-19 certainly impacted youth social health, this piece is purely technical/mathematical about viral spread dynamics without any demographic-specific analysis or behavioral insights that would align with the cluster's focus on youth social outcomes.</div>
