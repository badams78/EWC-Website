            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines declining social engagement and behavioral patterns among young people, particularly those aged 15-25. Articles analyze reduced time spent socializing, attending parties, and engaging in traditional social activities, alongside trends in conscientiousness and mental health indicators. Data primarily comes from longitudinal surveys like the American Time Use Survey, educational assessments, and psychological studies tracking generational changes. Unlike sibling clusters focused on housing markets, population economics, or climate-related property risks, this subcluster centers on sociological and public health dimensions of youth behavior within urban contexts, exploring how changing social norms and digital lifestyles impact community engagement and individual development patterns.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article about cooling paint technology has been misclassified, as it focuses on engineering innovation for temperature control rather than youth social behavior patterns. The article should be reassigned to the "Ocean Temperature Records & Climate Impact" cluster since it deals with temperature regulation technology that could have climate-related applications, making it much more relevant to environmental and climate topics than youth behavioral trends.</div>
