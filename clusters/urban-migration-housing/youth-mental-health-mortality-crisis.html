            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the intersection of youth behavioral changes, mental health trends, and broader societal impacts including mortality patterns. Articles predominantly analyze survey data from sources like BLS American Time Use Survey and longitudinal studies tracking teenage social engagement, conscientiousness decline, and psychological wellbeing indicators. The focus spans social media usage patterns, party attendance drops, and mental health statistics among 12-24 year olds. Unlike sibling subclusters addressing housing economics or disaster costs, this collection emphasizes demographic and behavioral shifts affecting younger populations, incorporating public health data and psychological research to understand emerging social trends and their broader economic implications within urban contexts.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Youth Mental Health & Mortality Crisis" cluster because it focuses on Alzheimer's research in an elderly population (age 67) rather than youth-specific mental health issues or mortality patterns.
