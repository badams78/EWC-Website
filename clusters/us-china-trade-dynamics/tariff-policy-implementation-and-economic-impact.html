            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the concrete implementation of tariff policies and their measurable economic consequences within US-China trade relations. Articles predominantly feature quantitative analyses from government agencies like the CBO, academic economists, and policy researchers, utilizing product-level pricing data, household impact studies, and revenue forecasting models. The focus centers on pass-through rates, inflation effects, GDP impacts, and distributional consequences across income levels. Unlike its sibling cluster examining broader dollar strength and trade balance dynamics, this subcluster emphasizes granular policy mechanics, specific tariff exemptions, and empirical measurement of immediate economic effects on consumers, retailers, and government revenues.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P9_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Tariff Policy Implementation and Economic Impact" cluster because while it discusses economic impacts (price rises affecting lower-income households), it focuses on general inflationary effects on income distribution rather than the specific implementation and quantitative analysis of tariff policies within US-China trade relations that defines this subcluster. The content aligns much better with the "Income Growth vs Inflation Dynamics" cluster, as it directly examines how inflation disproportionately affects different income groups without any explicit connection to tariff policy mechanisms.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it provides quantitative data on business pricing behavior, it focuses on general cost-price passthrough mechanisms rather than specifically examining tariff policy implementation or US-China trade relations.
