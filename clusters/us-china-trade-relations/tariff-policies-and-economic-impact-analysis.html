            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the direct economic consequences of US tariff policies, particularly focusing on quantitative impact assessments and empirical analysis. Articles predominantly feature economic modeling, revenue forecasting, and statistical analysis from sources like the CBO, along with perspectives from economists and policy analysts. The content emphasizes measurable outcomes including GDP effects, household costs, pass-through rates, and distributional impacts across income levels. Unlike the sibling Trade Balances and Currency Dynamics cluster which examines broader bilateral economic flows and exchange rate mechanisms, this subcluster specifically analyzes how tariff implementation translates into concrete economic costs and benefits for consumers, businesses, and government revenues.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions economic impacts on households, it focuses specifically on inflation's distributional effects across income groups rather than analyzing tariff policies and their quantitative economic consequences. The content aligns much better with income and inflation dynamics (as indicated by the higher similarity to the alternative cluster) than with tariff policy analysis.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses cost-price passthrough rates that are relevant to understanding how tariffs affect consumer prices, it doesn't explicitly mention tariffs and instead focuses on general business pricing behavior during 2022-23.
