            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the monetary and trade flow dimensions of US-China economic tensions, focusing on currency dynamics, trade balance data, and capital movements. Articles analyze official statistics on Chinese exports, GDP contributions, and foreign exchange reserves, alongside central bank policies and gold purchases. Coverage includes renminbi internationalization, manufactured goods surpluses, and dollar weakness impacts on equity markets. The subcluster uniquely emphasizes quantitative trade data and monetary policy responses, drawing from official government statistics, central bank reports, and financial market analysis. It captures both macroeconomic indicators and microeconomic behaviors like wealthy Chinese establishing Singapore family offices.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P6_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Currency and Trade Balance Dynamics" cluster because while it discusses capital movements (wealthy Chinese moving money to Singapore family offices), it focuses more on wealth management services and regulatory/structural changes rather than monetary policy, currency fluctuations, or trade balance statistics. The article is more about corporate financial services and market structure changes, which better aligns with the alternative "Corporate Valuations & Market Concentration" cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article about gambling as a national epidemic and social media's role in creating mob behavior has virtually no connection to currency dynamics, trade balances, or US-China economic relations that define the assigned cluster. The content is fundamentally about social behavior and public health issues related to gambling, making it a clear misclassification that should belong in the "Youth Health & Social Behavior Decline" cluster instead.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P14_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions a Chinese financial executive and Singapore (which could relate to capital flows), it focuses on a personal disappearance story rather than analyzing currency dynamics, trade balances, or monetary policy between the US and China. The content is more about individual circumstances and potential domestic Chinese issues rather than the macroeconomic trade and financial data that defines this cluster.</div>
