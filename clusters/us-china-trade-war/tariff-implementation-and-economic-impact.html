            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the concrete implementation of tariffs and their measurable economic consequences within US-China trade relations. Articles focus on quantitative analysis of tariff pass-through rates, revenue projections, GDP impacts, and distributional effects across income groups. Common sources include Congressional Budget Office forecasts, product-level pricing data, retailer testimonials, and economic modeling studies. Content emphasizes empirical measurement of policy outcomes, from household cost burdens to federal revenue generation. Unlike its sibling cluster on currency and trade balance dynamics, this subcluster prioritizes direct tariff mechanics and immediate economic transmission effects rather than broader monetary or macroeconomic equilibrium considerations.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Tariff Implementation and Economic Impact" cluster because while it discusses economic impacts, it focuses on general inflationary effects on different income groups rather than specifically examining tariff implementation or US-China trade consequences. The content aligns more closely with income inequality and inflation dynamics, which explains its higher similarity to the "Income Growth vs. Inflation Reality" cluster.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P9_S0</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses cost-price passthrough (a key mechanism in tariff implementation), it doesn't specifically mention tariffs or US-China trade relations, instead focusing broadly on how businesses pass costs to consumers.
