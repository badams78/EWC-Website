            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines tax policy effectiveness and progressivity toward high-income earners, analyzing whether wealthy individuals pay proportionate tax rates. Articles frequently cite specific tax data from sources like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Forbes 400 analysis, and academic research on effective tax rates across income brackets. Common perspectives include policy analysts, tax researchers, and economists debating inheritance taxes, international tax avoidance, and corporate tax concentration. Unlike the sibling subcluster focusing on wealth concentration statistics, this group emphasizes tax system design, rate structures, and policy proposals affecting high earners, often revealing gaps between statutory and actual tax burdens on the wealthy.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions millionaires (high earners), it focuses on wealth migration patterns and demographic projections rather than examining tax policy effectiveness or whether wealthy individuals pay proportionate tax rates. The content aligns more closely with economic migration trends than with tax policy analysis, making the alternative "Urban Population Shifts & Economic Migration" cluster a better fit.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the tax policy cluster because while it discusses Elizabeth Warren's policy proposal affecting high earners (private equity firms), it focuses primarily on corporate liability and regulatory reform rather than tax rates or progressivity. The proposal is more about industrial/regulatory policy intervention in private equity practices than about how much wealthy individuals or firms pay in taxes.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it involves tax policy affecting wealthy individuals (inheritance tax on high-value estates), it focuses on a specific referendum outcome rather than analyzing tax policy effectiveness or whether high earners pay proportionate rates. The content is more about democratic rejection of a wealth tax proposal than systematic examination of tax progressivity, making it only tangentially related to the cluster's core theme of analyzing tax policy effectiveness toward high-income earners.</div>
