            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines how tax policies specifically affect wealthy Americans, analyzing effective tax rates, inheritance levies, and policy reforms like the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Articles frequently cite academic research, think tank analyses, and data from sources like Forbes 400 wealth rankings and UBS projections. Content includes policy evaluations, cross-national tax comparisons, and assessments of tax progressivity claims. Unlike its sibling subcluster focusing on wealth concentration trends and measurements, this group emphasizes the mechanisms and impacts of fiscal policy tools designed to address or influence wealth inequality among high-net-worth individuals and top earners.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P13_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions millionaires (wealthy individuals), it focuses on global wealth migration patterns and population projections rather than specific tax policy impacts on wealthy Americans. The content aligns more with demographic and migration trends than with tax policy analysis, tax rates, or legislative reforms affecting the wealthy.</div>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P8_S3</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it discusses Elizabeth Warren's proposal that could financially impact wealthy private equity firm owners, the core focus is on corporate liability and worker protections rather than specific tax policy mechanisms or tax rates affecting the wealthy. The proposal is more about regulatory reform of business structures than traditional tax policy, making it more aligned with industrial/market policy debates.</div>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline for the "Tax Policy Impact on Wealthy Americans" cluster because it discusses inheritance tax policy affecting the wealthy, but focuses specifically on Swiss voters and policy rather than American taxpayers. While the tax policy concept aligns with the cluster's theme, the geographic focus on Switzerland makes it a poor fit for a cluster specifically about wealthy Americans.</div>
