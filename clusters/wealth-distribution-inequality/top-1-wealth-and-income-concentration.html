            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines the concentration of wealth and income among America's highest earners, particularly the top 1% and 0.1% of households. Articles analyze wealth distribution trends using data from sources like the Survey of Consumer Finances, Congressional Budget Office, and Federal Reserve statistics. Common themes include billionaire population growth, inheritance patterns, business ownership as primary income source for top earners, and methodological debates over measuring tax evasion and wealth concentration. Coverage spans household asset composition, stock market exposure effects, and comparative analysis of wealth shares across different percentiles of the distribution over time periods from 1979 to present.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions research by scholars known for studying top 1% wealth concentration, the content specifically focuses on a methodological dispute about tax evasion estimation rather than directly analyzing wealth or income concentration patterns. The article would fit better in the "Tax Policy and High Earner Progressivity" cluster since it's fundamentally about tax compliance methodology and estimation techniques.</div>
