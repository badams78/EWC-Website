            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines empirical trends in wealth and income concentration among America's highest earners, particularly the top 1% and 0.1% of households. Articles predominantly analyze Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances data, Congressional Budget Office reports, and academic working papers to track evolving wealth shares over decades. Content focuses on quantifying concentration patterns through specific statistics, examining asset composition differences between wealth tiers, and documenting how stock market exposure and business ownership drive inequality dynamics. The subcluster emphasizes data-driven analysis of measurable trends rather than policy prescriptions, featuring research from economists like Zucman and Splinter who debate methodological approaches to wealth measurement.</p>

            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions research by scholars known for studying top wealth concentration, the content specifically focuses on a methodological dispute about tax evasion estimation rather than presenting actual trends or data about wealth concentration among the top 1%. The article would fit better in the "Tax Policy Impact on Wealthy Americans" cluster since it directly addresses tax evasion methodology, which is fundamentally a tax policy measurement issue.</div>
