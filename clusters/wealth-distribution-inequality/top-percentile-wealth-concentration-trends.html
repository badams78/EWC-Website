            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This subcluster examines empirical data and trends regarding wealth concentration among the highest-earning households, particularly the top 1% and 0.1% of income and wealth distributions. Articles primarily analyze quantitative datasets from sources like the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, Congressional Budget Office reports, and academic research papers tracking long-term distributional changes. The content focuses on specific metrics such as wealth shares, income percentiles, asset composition differences, and methodological debates over measurement approaches. Coverage includes stock market exposure disparities, business ownership as primary income sources for top earners, inheritance patterns, and cross-national comparisons of household savings behaviors, providing detailed statistical portraits of how wealth accumulates and concentrates at the distribution's apex.</p>

            <div class="meta">Almost classified as: P12_S1</div>
            <div class="edge-reason">This article is borderline because while it mentions a working paper by researchers who study wealth concentration, the content specifically focuses on a methodological dispute about tax evasion estimation rather than presenting actual data or trends about top percentile wealth concentration. The article would fit better in the "Tax Policy and High Earner Contributions" cluster since it directly addresses tax evasion methodology, which is more central to tax policy discussions than wealth concentration analysis.</div>
